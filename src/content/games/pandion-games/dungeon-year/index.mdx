# What is a Dungeon Year?

Build anything you can imagine, one piece a day.

The Dungeon Year is a daily creative challenge, mental exercise, a game itself, and a moment of meditation. You can start your Dungeon Year on any day in any month, and take as long as you want to complete it.

The idea was started by Sean Mccoy, the game designer behind the Mothership RPG: To build a megadungeon one room a day in 2023 consisting of 12 levels, with 28-31 rooms each, called #dungeon23.

His initiative sparked the idea of this journal and the Dungeon Year: To create something, one piece at a time until you have completed 365 details: rooms, characters, cultures, maps, stars, gods, items, and more.

And when you’re done, perhaps you’ll have a massive interstellar spaceship, a new world to explore, a community of people and their relationships, a city, and yes, maybe even a dungeon.

Create anything you want.
