A solo+ survival mystery TTRPG utilizing step-down dice and card draw mechanics, Substratum Protocol is playable as both a solo game or guided by a GM.

With players taking on the role of Earth's best remaining scientists, Substratum Protocol is our entry into the Deep Delving Mystery genre (like Subnautica and In Other Waters).

On their grueling journey to the center of the Earth, members of the Substratum Expedition will overcome challenges, gain clues and knowledge of the anomaly, discover creatures, aliens, cosmic horrors, and ultimately assemble their final hypothesis to overcome the apocalypse looming before them.

## Descend. Learn. Survive.

With over 90 pages crammed full of tables, creatures, mysteries, clues, and questions to answer, this will become your go-to game for impromptu sessions, short campaigns, or solo game nights.

The game intertwines hard science fiction with the inescapable, unknowable horrors of an anomaly tearing apart reality.
