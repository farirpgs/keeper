Vines draw you into a slithering embrace; tendrils burrow into your body, encasing your corpse in a shell of moldering bark and fungal ridges. You belong to the forest now, a puppet of its malign intelligence.

Chronicles of the Boundless is the soulslike horror RPG carved in bark and bones. Play as brave souls trying to find their way in a world grown dark under the shadow of an otherworldly woods bound to the spirit world.

> Who are you? The warrior who deserted an army with a meaningless goal? The druid from a clan whose entire culture is deemed heretical? The mage, educated in secret, with powers as potent as they are likely to lead to the gallows? The priest who lost faith in the One Light and now seeks to discern truth from lies? The hunter who chose to adapt, becoming one with the darkness that plagues the world? Or the rogue, whose life was always cloaked in deceit and sorrow, now free to live to the fullest?
