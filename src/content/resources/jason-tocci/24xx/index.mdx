# Rules

Text by Jason Tocci under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license (CC BY 4.0)

## Play

Players describe what their characters do. The GM advises when their action is impossible, demands a cost or extra steps, or presents a risk. Players can revise plans before committing so as to change goal/stakes. Only roll to avoid risk.

## Rolling

Roll a skill die — d6 by default, higher with a relevant skill, or d4 if hindered by injury or circumstances. If helped by circumstances, roll an extra d6; if helped by an ally, they roll their skill die and share the risk. Take the highest die.

- 1–2 Disaster. Suffer the full risk. GM decides if you succeed at all. If risking death, you die.
- 3–4 Setback. A lesser consequence or partial success. If risking death, you’re injured.
- 5+ Success. The higher the roll, the better.

If success can’t get you what you want (you make the shot, but it’s bulletproof!), you’ll at least get useful info or set up an advantage.

## Load

Carry as much as makes sense, but more than one bulky item may hinder you at times.

## Advancement

After a job, each character increases a skill (none⮕d8⮕d10⮕d12) and gains d6 credits (₡).

## Defense

Say how one of your items breaks to turn a hit into a brief hindrance. Broken gear is useless until repaired.

## Harm

Injuries take time and/or medical attention to heal. If killed, make a new character to introduce ASAP. Favor inclusion over realism.

## GM

Describe characters in terms of behaviors, risks, and obstacles, not skill dice. Lead the group in setting lines not to cross in play. Fast-forward, pause, or rewind/redo for pacing and safety; invite players to do likewise. Present dilemmas you don’t know how to solve. Move spotlight to give all time to shine. Test as needed for bad luck (e.g., run out of ammo, or into guards) — roll a die to check for (1– 2) trouble or (3–4) signs of it. Improvise rulings to cover gaps in rules; on a break, revise unsatisfactory rulings as a group.

# Characters

> // SRD design notes start with two slashes, like this. Other paragraphs are player/GM-facing text.

# GM Page

## The Premise

> // Explain the basics of the setting. If it’s not made clear elsewhere, give a reason for the characters to stick together, and hint at what they’ll spend their time doing.

## Back Page

> // If you’d like to mimic the style of the original micro RPGs this SRD is based on, the back page (or the left half of one side of a letter-sized sheet of paper) can fit 4 tables of 20 items each. A GM can use these to generate ideas for an improvised session, like, “[Name] has hired you for [Job] at [Location], but there’s a [Twist]!” An example table is offered below.

## Adding To Rules

> // This SRD is very brief, with the hope experienced RPG players will fill in the gaps confidently, and RPG newcomers will be free of too many preconceived notions. Anything left vague is deliberately open to interpretation. (Like: Can you get help dice from an ally AND circumstances on one roll? Your call!) Expand or clarify as needed. My own principles for new rules are to minimize addition and subtraction, avoid too much bookkeeping (on top of tracking credits, hindrances, number of bulky items, and which items are broken), and strive to use terms either self-evident in meaning or invitingly vague.

**► Roll d20 for a contact, client, rival, or target**

<div class="rolling-table-2">
  <div>1 Arcimboldo, quirky tech dealer & tinkerer</div>
  <div>2 Aurora, wealthy collector of unique items</div>
  <div>3 Blackout, quiet evidence removal specialist</div>
  <div>4 Bleach, wry janitor android turned assassin</div>
  <div>5 Bron, dour security chief with a metal arm</div>
  <div>6 Bullet, no-nonsense android gun runner</div>
  <div>7 Carryout, cocky courier with fast cyber-legs</div>
  <div>8 Fisher, eager street kid looking for a crew</div>
  <div>9 Ginseng, people-loving drug dealer</div>
  <div>10 Hot Ticket, extremely cautious fence</div>
  <div>11 Kaiser, grinning loan shark in a silver suit</div>
  <div>12 Osiris, tired, street-level sawbones</div>
  <div>13 Powder Blue, android fxer, generous rates</div>
  <div>14 Reacher, sharp mercenary tac squad leader</div>
  <div>15 Rhino, thickheaded, bighearted bodyguard</div>
  <div>16 Sam, plucky journalist, likely to get killed</div>
  <div>17 Shifter, hard-working chop-shop owner</div>
  <div>18 Walleye, businesslike information broker</div>
  <div>19 Whistler, smiling cabbie/getaway driver</div>
  <div>20 “X,” unfappable broker for an unnamed corp</div>
</div>

**► Roll d6 to try to find a job. Spend ₡1 to re-roll.**

- **1–2** Nothing. Spend to re-roll, or risk debt.
- **3–4** Found a job, but there’s a catch.
- **5–6** Choose between 2 jobs.

## Finding Jobs

> // Many teams don’t need to look for paying work (e.g., military units). If your game does use this setup, though, dangerous jobs should pay more to cover 1–3 credits in “expenses” for medical treatment, fixing/replacing broken gear, re-rolling unsavory jobs, or getting through dry spells with no jobs. Also, in the table above, the phrase “owe somebody” is intentionally vague, but may be worth clarifying or alluding to elsewhere (e.g., put a loan shark in your “Contacts” table).

## Jobs

> // The list of jobs (or missions, situations, quests, etc.) should be tailored for your setting, and suggest scenarios where every character’s skills will be useful. Common job templates include “deal with an unusual threat,” “investigate something seemingly inexplicable,” or “retrieve a thing from a location for a person.” They serve as “gameable lore” — elements that hint at a setting, ready-made for use in play.

## License

## Give Credit

> // See that tiny text along the bottom of the page? That’s where I cram the version number and credit for licensed content (like the cover art). You’re welcome to put it elsewhere in your game, but be sure to include it somewhere — like, “24XX rules are CC BY Jason Tocci.”

## Use 24xx, Not 2400

> // You can say your game is “compatible with 2400” or “for use with 2400,” but please don’t use material directly from 2400, or name your game so it looks like it’s part of my 2400 series (unless you have explicit approval).

## No Bigotry

> // Please don’t use any text from this game, the 24XX logo, or my name in any product that promotes or condones white supremacy, racism, misogyny, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, or other bigotry against marginalized groups.
