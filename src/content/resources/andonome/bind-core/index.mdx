# BIND: Not an SRD

BIND is an open-source game.

Anyone can change anything.

## Fate

- Every character can store a number of Fate Points (FP) equal to their total Experience Points (XP) divided by 10 (round up) plus their Charisma Bonus.
- If the character would receive Damage, they can elect to lose FP instead.

## Fatigue Points

- Every round of exertion inflicts one Fatigue Point.
- Every Fatigue Point a character has above their current Health Points (HP) inflicts a -1 penalty to all actions.

## Weight

- Characters have a *Weight Rating* equal to their HP.
- Characters can lift anything with a Weight Rating up to their Strength score, without problem.
- Anything over the Weight Rating inflicts a -1 penalty to the character's Speed.
- Characters can lift a maximum Weight Rating equal to 4 plus their Strength Bonus.
- Characters can drag a maximum Weight Rating equal to 8 plus their Strength Bonus.

# Actions

## Dangerous & Difficult Actions

Roll the dice to determine the state of the world.
The dice roll remains fixed, so anyone attempting the same action receives the same result.

1. The Judge states the Tie Number (TN):
    * 7 for difficult actions,
    * 12 for professional actions,
    * 16 for extreme.
1.  The player rolls 2D6, and adds:
    * Attribute Bonus,
    * Skill Bonus,
    * Equipment Bonus.
1. The Judge interprets the results:
    * If the roll exceeds the TN, the action was a success.
    * If the roll falls below the TN, the action fails, and the danger occurs.
    * If the roll equals the TN, the result is a *tie*.
    * If success and failure conditions could occur at the same time, the character may choose to accept both, or neither.
    * Otherwise, the result is a partial success.


## Difficulty at Rest

When characters can try something again and again, set one die to a '6' and roll as normal.

## Resisted Actions

The player rolls at TN 7 plus the opponent's Bonuses.

# Combat

## Action Points


1.  Everyone in the room sets their Action Points (AP) to 3 + Speed.
1.  Every action costs at least 1 AP.
1.  Circle round the table, with each player taking their turn.
1.  However, if any character wants to jump in, use this order:
    1. The character who has the most AP goes first.
    1. The character doing the action which requires the least AP to spend.
    1. The character with the highest Speed.
    1. The character with the shortest name.

## Spending Action Points

Characters can spend AP on the following:

- Guarding someone costs 1 AP.
- Anyone attacking the target must successfully attack you first (without dealing Damage).
- They can then spend AP to attack the target immediately.
- Movement costs 1 AP and allows people to move 3 steps + their Speed Bonus.
- Punching or pushing costs 1 AP.
- The cost to attack depends upon the weapon.
- Taking out a weapon which has been placed to-hand costs 1 AP.
- Using items (such as drinking potions or reading books) costs 3 AP.

## Attacking

The characters rolls a *resisted action*.

- Weapons require Dexterity + Combat.
- Grabbing employs Dexterity + Brawl.
- Running away uses Speed + Athletics.

### Damage

Characters have 6 HP, plus their Strength Bonus.

- Fists deal 1D4 Damage.
- Weapons each have their own die-type.
- The character's Strength Bonus adds to the result.

## Weapons

Weapons add to a character's Attack and Damage.
Heavier weapons have some 'Heft', which costs more AP.

| **Name**     | **Attack Bonus** | **Damage Bonus** | **AP Cost**        | **Weight**       |
|:-------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:------------------:|:----------------:|
| Dagger       |    0             |        2         |         1          |       -1         |
| Javelin      |    2             |        1         |         2          |        1         |
| Longsword    |    2             |        2         |         2          |        1         |
| Shortsword   |    1             |        1         |         1          |        0         |

## Armour

Armour provides Damage Resistance (DR), which can protect against Damage, but only if the PC rolls high enough.

- If PCs fail an Attack roll by a number equal to the armour's Covering, the attack is a *Vitals Shot*, and the armour provides no DR.
- When attack rolls fail by a number less than the armour's Covering, the Damage is reduced by the armour's DR.
- When PCs succeed in an Attack roll by *more* than their opponent's Covering, they inflict a Vitals Shot, and ignore the opponent's DR.

**Armour**  | **DR**  |**Covering**  |**Weight**
------------|---------|--------------|------------
Leather     |3        |3             |0
Chain       |4        |3             |1

## Projectiles

- Players roll Dexterity + Projectiles against TN 5 to hit stationary targets.
- Every 5 steps adds +1 to the TN.
- Moving targets increase the TN with their Speed + Athletics total.
- When a player hits the TN precisely, they miss their first target, but any other target behind.

## Spells

- Casters can store a number of Mana Points (MP) equal to the number of spheres they have times three.
- Casters can spend a number of MP equal to the highest sphere they are using to cast a spell.
- Casters without MP lose Fatigue Points instead.
- A failed spell rips double the normal MP from the caster.

# Intervals

The day has four intervals:

1. Morning
1. Afternoon
1. Evening
1. Night

At the end of each Interval, a number of things happen:

- The Judge rolls 1D6, and every character who took part in the Interval regenerates that many FP
- Characters who rested for the Interval regenerate a number of Fatigue Points equal to half their current HP (rounded up).
- The Judge divides a number of MP between everything in the area which can hold MP (round up).
    - MP comes in the wind, so windy locations allow faster regeneration.
    - Anything with MP then receives penalties for shielding their bodies against the air.
    - Equivalent heavy clothing provides the same penalties.

| Place        |MP Regenerated|
|:------------:|:------------:|
| Underground  | 1            |
| Indoors      | 2            |
| Outdoors     | 3            |
| Storm        | 4            |
