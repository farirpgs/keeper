# Storyteller Creator’s Guide

By Pandion Games
Version 1.0

![](https://i.imgur.com/XmuAiSrl.png)

## What is Storyteller?

This Creator’s Guide is for making your own games, content and supplements using the mechanics from Pandion Game’s Storyteller Narrative Campfire Game, which can be found at [https://pandiongames.itch.io/the-storyteller](https://pandiongames.itch.io/the-storyteller).

Storyteller is an ad-lib narrative system that uses a Story Prompt to create the structure of the tale to be told, and a character profile for creating characters. Each of these are used by fill-in-the-blanket options for each ad-lib. Action resolution is done through completion of different kinds of tasks.

## The Core Design Principle

It is important that the mechanics conform to the core design principle:

**Play happens while out camping, around a campfire, with only the materials or items campers would likely have on hand during such a trip.**

Don’t assume they have dice, pencils, bright indoor lighting, a flat playing surface or are gathered closely next to each other at a table.

This does not mean players must play outside or around a campfire, but the design or change of any mechanics should revolve around that core principle.

## Using this Guide

This guide will describe the core mechanics and concepts for Storyteller games. If you wish to use this creator resource to simply expand on Storyteller’s Character Profiles and Story Prompt options, monster descriptions, or folklore and legends, we have provided descriptions below to help write that.

If you want to create a Crafted with Storyteller game that uses a different theme, tone, or genre a new Story Prompt may need to be created, which will affect the options, and we provide guidance on that as well. Generally, the Character Prompt itself will not need to be changed, but that is ultimately up to you.

## Safety Tools

Anything created using the Storyteller Creator's Guide should include some kind of safety section. Call out potential content warnings, explain your favorite safety mechanics, such as X-Cards, Rewinds, Script Changes and Lines and Veils. Be specific and remember the Core Design Principle. Most safety tools will need to be tweaked to accommodate it.

Ensure that people in an audience can signal discomfort in some way to the Storyteller subtly to not attract the unwanted attention of possibly tens of people.

The mechanics of this game lends itself very well to playing with children, as such it is doubly important to provide information, up front, to the expected audience, age and required maturity for your games and content. If your game needs adoption for play with children, add a note specifically to parents or adults what needs to occur.

# Modes of Play

Storyteller allows for two methods of play. **Game Mode** is a traditional RPG experience with The Storyteller acting as a narrator, Players who control their individual characters, an optional Picker who chooses the Story Prompt options and acts with the Storyteller in opposition to the remaining players as an antagonist, and finally Ghosts.

Ghosts, depending on your intended genre, can be renamed, given different tasks, or removed entirely. However, it is a mechanic to keep players whose characters were removed from the game engaged in play.

In **Story Mode**, The Storyteller is telling a story to an audience, with participation, and encourages interaction through the use of the Story Stick and Hard Decision mechanics.

# Roles in Storyteller Games

### The Storyteller

Performs the core narration of the story, and has the final say on if something is feasible.

### Player

Makes decisions for an individual character of the group in the story. If a character is removed from the story, the player takes on the role of a Ghost.

### The Picker

Fills out the Story Prompt and quietly acts as the antagonist against the Characters. The Storyteller confers with the Picker about the antagonist's actions during the story. They can also perform the tasks of a Ghost immediately.

> For groups of 3 or fewer players, everyone can pick a Story Prompt option. The Storyteller should pick the Happenings and Ending, keeping them secret, and play the part of the antagonist as well.

### Ghosts

These are Players whose characters are removed from the game. They should be encouraged to move away from the campfire or light source and make occasional mood appropriate noises. Ghosts can also stage whisper questions and comments.

# The Story Stick

As understated as the name sounds, The Story Stick is an important part of the Storyteller Mechanics. It allows for anti-cannon play in an orderly fashion and is one of the mechanics that allows for a larger group of players and audiences.

If you are changing mechanics, genre, and prompts to fit your goals, give serious consideration to the Story Stick and how it will interact with your audience and players. What do you want the person who holds the story stick to be able to do that no one else can until they get it?

As written, whoever is holding the story stick can interject one scene or setting detail into the story that the Storyteller then incorporates as canon.

The player then passes the stick off to another. If someone wants to add a detail, they need to get a hold of the story stick first, either by asking for it, or waiting for it to be passed around. Players cannot add two details in a row.

Finally, the Storyteller may ask the holder of the story stick for a detail or ask for it to be passed around, or to specific players. This is also used with audiences to help them participate.

# Hard Decisions

Hard Decisions are the resolution mechanics in Storyteller games. Players complete a type of task with three levels of completion and are split into 3 potential outcomes: Success, Partial Success and Failure.

This is one of our favorite mechanics, and we ask that you keep in mind the three styles of tasks to complete Hard Decisions: Physical, Skill, and Knowledge.

- **Physical Tasks** are those that use our body’s strength and endurance. Completing a certain amount of push-ups, completing a handstand, performing a race (between the player and the antagonist for instance).
- **Skill Tasks** are those that require reactions or some other skillful action. Such as playing rock-paper-scissors, catching three objects rapidly, flipping a long object quickly and catching it by the right side, or flipping a bottle to land on its top.
- **Knowledge Tasks** are things such as identifying three types of plants around you, knowing or tying a certain number of knots, or answering trivia or study questions.

### Success

The task occurs successfully, as intended, without negative consequences.

### Partial Success

The task occurs successfully, but a consequence or minor setback.

### Failure

The task is failed and there are negative or dire consequences.

### Group Hard Decisions

For really tense scenes, use a series of Hard Decisions. Have the Players in the scene perform three or more tasks to determine the ultimate fate of the scene - the more difficult the scene, the more tasks you assign. Narrate the minutiae that happens after each task completes. If there are more successes than failures, the scene ends positively and vice versa. Partial successes are neutral and don’t count towards a positive or negative count. A tie between successes and failures is a minor setback.

# Story Mode

Design your content to allow telling of specific stories without direct player interactions. Hard Decisions and The Story Stick are still used in Story Mode to allow the audience the ability to change or interact with the story without having to ‘play a game’.

**Most importantly, Story Mode allows interactive play with large groups of people - Scout Troops and whole classes of students.**

### Filling in the Prompts

Allow the audience to participate in setting up the Story Prompts. Pose questions that the Storyteller can ask to get input.

### Audience to Players

In your games, discuss methods the Storyteller can use to draw audience members to make decisions for individual characters they have become attached to. This will be a little different depending on how your game is constructed.

# The Story Prompt

This is Storyteller’s core Story Prompt. If writing for a new genre (not horror), consider changing the wording and even the fill-in-the-blank labels. That said, this prompt layout can be easily changed to adjacent genres with tweaking the prompt options, and maybe the title of the prompt (Such as “Antagonist” to “Mastermind” for a mystery game).

Make it clear that even though we define the ‘ending’ in the story prompt, it is more of a guide for how the Storyteller can wrap up the game, and shouldn’t be set in stone.

Our story begins in LOCATION in the MOOD SETTING .
A group of CHARACTER GROUP discovers DISCOVERY **.
The ANTAGONIST is HAPPENINGS .
In the end, **ENDING\*\*.

## Story Prompt Options

### Locations

Geographical Locations, such as a state, national park, or cities.

### Mood

What is the overall mood of the story? Think of this as a sub-genre. Maybe it’s an eerie story, so the setting is shrouded in fog and silence. Or perhaps it is bloody, and thus will be more graphic than usual (and a perfect time to redo your Safety Tools discussion).

### Setting

Specific Location the story takes place. The haunted mansion in the city. The campground in the park. The lake in the forest.

### Character Group

Who are the players? Why are they all working together? What kind of group do they form?

### Discovery

Inciting incident. This is the event that tips off the characters that something isn’t right; the start of the journey.

### Antagonist

Who or what is the opposition of the players? A monster, a mastermind, a catastrophic weather event.

### Happenings

What are the real goals of the Antagonist? What is actually happening that the characters must solve, uncover, defeat or survive?

### Ending

How does this story end? This is a great place to define, to the Storyteller, how difficult this game should be.

# Character Profile

These profiles should not generally need to be changed regardless of genre, however if you do change them, we would challenge you to leave in Age Description. Our play testers have enjoyed finding unique ways of describing their characters without the use of a ‘year's old’ numeric marker.

Strengths provide something the character is uniquely skillful at narratively, but provide no bonuses. The Personality Trait, Secret, Ideal and Flaw should describe who the character is as a person and help towards playing them.

## FULL

My name is NAME. (PRONOUNS )
I am AGE DESCRIPTION .
Most people would describe me as PERSONALITY TRAIT.
I joined the group because of my STRENGTH and STRENGTH.  
But I hide SECRET from them.
I believe that IDEAL, but my FLAW causes my problems.

## CORE

My name is NAME. (PRONOUNS)
I am AGE DESCRIPTION.
Most people would describe me as PERSONALITY TRAIT.

## Character Profile Options

Most of these are self-explanatory. However, if you’re looking for examples to start with, we provide many in Storyteller. We will happily provide a free download link to anyone trying to build something with the Creator’s Guide. Reach out to us via Twitter @PandionGames.

- Age Descriptions
- Personality Traits
- Strengths
- Secrets
- Ideals
- Flaws

# Antagonist Descriptions

This section is to provide 1-2 sentence summaries of each Antagonist option to help the Picker and Storyteller better understand the Antagonist and how to depict it.

# Story Twists

This optional mechanic helps create more interesting stories by defining a plot twist that throws the whole narrative on its head. The Storyteller selects a twist and weaves it into the story when appropriate. We offer several Twists in Storyteller. You are welcome to copy those, or come up with your own.

# Folklore and Legends

Most Antagonists - monsters, characters, or even epic events - have an origin or background story. Select several of your Antagonist options and expand and tell the larger story and history of where they or it came from.
