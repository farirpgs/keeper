## WHAT IS THE IMPOSITION SRD?

The Imposition Dice System is about simple mechanics that support narrative focused Tabletop Tope Roleplaying Games. Every dice roll, whether a success or failure, should be impactful and drive the narrative forward in fun and interesting ways.

There is no assumed game type that the dice system is trying to capture. Instead, this is handled through character options. Originally developed for The Crypt Has Opened, the combination of Spell Paths, Traditions, and Tropes supported a game of horror and mystery. By altering the character options you can develop a game focused on combat, social engagements & mystery, or a slice of life.

After reading this document you should have all of the tools necessary to make your own game driven by the Imposition Dice System. I also hope you will have a firm understanding of the underpinning mechanics such that you will feel empowered to alter them so that they best fit your game's theme.

## WHAT IS THIS?

This is the SRD or System Reference Document. Inside you will find information on the underlying game mechanics and philosophy of the Imposition Dice System. By using this document you should feel confident on how best to develop your own game using the Imposition Dice System.

## GAME SETUP

The game is assumes that there will be one Game Master (GM) and three to five players. The Imposition Dice System relies heavily on improvisational and cooperative storytelling between GM and players. Preparation on the GM side should only take a few minutes as their role is to present situations ([see Running the Game](#running-the-game)) be reactionary to the player’s choices.

Each player should have at minimum one d4, d6, d8, d10, and a d12. Though having three of each would help alleviate the problem of needing to roll a single die multiple times.

Finally each player will need a character sheet and something to write with.

## LEAN INTO FAILURE

With this system you will experience more consequences and failures than full on success. Do not be afraid of this. Instead, lean into it. You will find that this is where the story takes place. Use every set back as a chance to develop your character, the ties you have between the party, and the story that’s being told. And it makes the successes all the more sweet when everything seems the bleakest.

# CORE MECHANICS

## RESOLUTION MECHANIC

All resolutions fall within one of three outcomes. Failure, Success with Consequences, and Full Success. The player rolls three dice, two of which are derived from the character sheet. They are the Level Die and Path Die. The third die is a difficulty die given to them by the GM called the Imposition Die (ID).

To determine how successful a task is, the player rolls all three dice and compares the individual values on the dice against one another. Their goal is to get the individual values of their two dice to meet or beat the value of the ID. If that is the case then it is a Full Success. The player gets exactly what they were going for.

If only one of their two dice meets are beats the value of the ID then they've encountered a Success with Consequences. While they may have achieved their goal, it comes at a cost. The cost should never override the success.

Finally, if the value on the ID is greater than both the Level and Path dice, then the character has failed at their task. The consequences for which can be minor setbacks to downright fatal ([see Severity of Outcome](#severity-of-outcome)).

Characters are not without their tricks, however. While the GM has the power to set the Imposition Die, the players have access to Aptitude ([see Paths](#paths)) which allows them the ability to lower the starting Imposition Die.

## THE THREE DICE

### LEVEL DIE

This die represents a character’s overall level or power and is rated on a scale of d4 to d12. It is the first of two dice the player rolls in order to overcome the Imposition Die. You are encouraged to name it something that instantly speaks to theme of your game. Spell Die, Martial Die, or Investigation Die all give an indication as to what the game is about. For the players this die will be the most consistent one.

For The Crypt Has Opened this die started at a d6, as the players were able to lower it for additional affects. This needn’t be the case for your game.

#### Dueling

An optional use for the Level Die is a mechanic for dueling characters. Much like an NPC has a Threat Die ([see Enemy Design](#enemy-design)) a player can lower their Level Die, to a minimum of a d4, to raise the Imposition Die of their opponent. Meaning that if a character has a d12 Level Die, they have the ability to impose up to 4 levels of Imposition.

### PATH DIE

This is the second die a player will roll to overcome the Imposition Die. This die will change the most from task to task. It is determined by whatever Path ([see Paths](#paths)) a player is using to overcome an obstacle. A character has many Paths to choose from, some more suited to achieving their goal than others. Each Path has a die associated with it that can range from a d4 to a d12.

### IMPOSITION DIE

The entire system revolves around the Imposition Die. Set by the GM, this die represents how difficult a task or obstacle is prior to character involvement. It can range from a d4 (an easy task) up to a d12 (a challenging task). Is the character attempting to climb a rocky wall with climbing gear? Sounds like an easy task of a d4. Is it smooth? Perhaps a d6 is more appropriate. Is it a sheer surface with covered in oil? Definitely a d12.

NPC opponents also fall under this rating by using their Level Die ([see Enemy Design](#enemy-design)).

The GM will always state the level of Imposition to the player so that they may make informed decisions. Having this information promotes making interesting and clever choices. Trying to intimidate a surly guard may be a d8 Imposition. But perhaps some honeyed words or the right bribe may mean a d6 or d4! Players are not committed to an action until the dice are rolled.

Characters are never stuck with the stated level of Imposition. Using their Aptitude ([see Paths](#paths)) they have the chance to lower the Imposition.

#### Constant Imposition

There may be circumstances where outside forces are acting on a character such that the base Imposition is raised by a number of Imposition Levels on an individual character basis. Perhaps an adventuring party is fighting a group of goblins, who each are rated as a d6. Anything the players attempt to do against the goblins starts at a d6. However, one party member is fighting off a poison affect, slowing them down. They could incur a level of Constant Imposition, making all of their tasks one level higher, thus turning the base Imposition of the goblins to a d8 for that character.

#### Irresistible Imposition

Some situations may call for a difficult situation to remain difficult, no matter how good a character may be. Irresistible Imposition means that a player cannot use their Aptitude to lower the Imposition and must face the problem head on.

Irresistible Imposition need not always be all or none. A GM may levee any number of levels, effectively reducing how much Aptitude a character may apply to a roll.

All is not lost, however, as a player may always spend Stress ([see Stress](#stress)) to reduce Imposition.

## PATHS

Also known in other games as Attributes or Traits, Paths give the player an idea on what the game is about. They are genre specific actions a character undertakes to solve problems or overcome obstacles. When coming up with a set of Paths, think about what kind of actions you want the players to undertake that facilitate an interesting narrative. They should be concrete and actionable.

How many paths should there be? As many as you feel the players will need to overcome different problems. Let’s make a game about collegiate wrestling. We’ll start with these Paths: Overpower, Explosiveness, Conditioning, and Tricks. Each of the Paths helps to the player what they’ll expect out of the game. It’s clear we’re focused on the character’s ability to wrestle!

During the match we now have interesting choices to make. Maybe you just want to Overpower your opponent to put yourself into an advantageous position, or rely on your Conditioning to outlast them, or maybe sneak in a Trick to put them off their guard.

However many Paths you choose, or whatever you’d like to call them, they are each rated on a die scale of d4 to d12. At character creation every Path starts at a d4.

### ASPECTS

Every Path has a number of Aspects listed under them. While a Path represents an action a player can take, the Aspect represents a specific area of that action the character is particularly good at. Using our collegiate wrestling example, we could have three Aspects for each Path. For Tricks we will have Trash Talk, Twisting, and Nope. Trash Talk is your character attempting to put your opponent off their game through words. Twisting is attempting to use illegal moves in secret to get an advantage on your opponent. Whereas Nope is your defense against being Tricked yourself!

Aren’t Trash Talk and Twisting essentially the same? Perhaps, but each may affect a character’s starting Imposition. If the referee is nearly on top of you both, making Twisting harder (d8). So perhaps Trash Talk a better option! Also, the narrative options for failing a Trash Talk versus Twisting become very different and may take the scene in wildly different directions.

Aspects are not rated by a die roll, but instead allow the player to lower Imposition per point of Aptitude within the Aspect.

#### Aptitude

Each Aspect can have up to five points of Aptitude. This represents just how good they are with that Aspect. Each point lowers the Imposition Die one step to a minimum of a d4.

A character’s Aptitude is limited by the Die Level of the Associated Path. So, a wrestler with a Trick of a d8 is only able to have three points in any or all of the associated Aspects Trash Talk, Twisting, and Nope.

## STRESS

When a character has no more Aptitude to put toward lowering Imposition or wants to overcome Irresistible Imposition, they can use Stress. Characters have 9 points of stress they can spend on any roll they wish. Each point spent lowers the Imposition by another die level. The player may spend as much Stress as they’d like per roll, but there is a cost. For every 3 Stress spent they incur a Constant Imposition of +1 to all future rolls. Once all 9 points are spent the character passes out. The Constant Imposition is only added after the roll that would incur the penalty.

Stress can also be spent to re-roll any roll. If the player had spent stress previously to lower the Imposition Die, they do not need to spend it again. They only need to tick off another Stress box and roll. They can do this as many times as they want until they pass out.

# CREATING A CHARACTER

## CORE STATS

Every character is comprised of:

- Name, Age, Pronouns
- Level Die - Ranging from a d4 to d12. Effectively the player's Level. The name may be changed to fit your theme. For the Crypt Has Opened this is the player's Spell Die, their overall skill with magic.
- Path Die - Before rolling the player chooses a Path to roll with the Level Die. As established in the Paths section, what these are will depend on the type of game you’re making.
- Aspects - These are specialized areas of a Path. Where the Path establishes the die being rolled, the Aspect grants...
- Aptitude - Dots, pips, or points in an Aspect that the player uses to lower the Imposition Die before rolling.

Optionally:

- Skills - Basic, everyday skills any character can have that help compliment but do not mimic Paths.
- Special Abilities - To add more variety or specialization to a character you can add bespoke special abilities that are one use powers that reset each day.

### STARTING LEVEL

A d6 level makes for a character that may be starting in their career but isn’t completely incompetent. There is still room to grow and even leaves the option for the dueling mechanic ([see Dueling](#dueling)).

### Starting Path Die

Each Path starts with a rating of d4. Through character creation they should end up with a spread that may be a d6 in one Path and a d8 in another, or a d6 in three Paths. The former makes for a more focused character while the later more spread out.

Determining these starting die levels will depend largely on if you’re using things like classes or playbooks. For instance, a class could provide your character with their starting Path Die increases.

### Starting Aptitude

We’ve found that 8 points of Aptitude creates a well rounded character to start. It gives the player enough points to focus on the Aspects they really like while leaving a few points for secondary and tertiary choices.

How these points are given to the player is entirely dependent upon your character creation process. If you have classes or playbooks then they may automatically give the character points in specific Aspects associated with that class. It is encouraged to give the player free floating points for them to assign as they wish.

## CHARACTER OPTIONS

Classes, Playbooks, or Freeform point buy is all dependent upon the themes and style of the game. Each has their pros and cons.

Classes help make distinct characters quickly and help you design how they’ll fit within the makeup of an entire party. With classes you would assign starting Path Die and Aptitudes for the player, as well as upgrades as they level. This helps those with analysis paralysis, but has the problem of every character of a class feeling the same. This method would require some changes to the base Advancement system ([see Advancement](#advancement)).

Playbooks are similar to classes but you can be a little looser with them. You can let a playbook set a character’s starting stats but as the character advances let the player make choices as to where those level die increases and aptitude points go. This opens up a character to changing along with the story as it unfolds and reacting to the world. However some players may feel directionless with this method and fear that they may be making the wrong choice and thus an ineffectual character.

Freeform as the ability to help a player make the exact type of character they want without restriction. However this can have issues of a character being unfocused and maybe not as fun as others, or being so open that a player has a hard time coming up with a character.

### Special Abilities

You may consider providing a list of special abilities for players to choose from or design specific abilities per class/playbook that’s unique to them alone. These special abilities or talents require the player to spend 3 stress for some kind of major effect. It should not require a roll for this effect to work.

When making a special ability for a specific class/playbook, it should be something that they are already specialized or is a core part of them such that using it makes for a big story pivot. It can either be a big single moment, or an effect that lasts for an entire scene.

If using special abilities, a player should be able to gain a new one on character advancement.

## THE OTHER STUFF

### EQUIPMENT

How you handle equipment is entirely dependent on what kind of game you’re running. For games about dungeon delving and looting, you may want a robust equipment section with specific gold amounts and uses for items. For more narrative games you may only need a section for players to jot down items they’ve collected during play or even a predefined list.

If you need to know every bit of equipment a player has on them we suggest using the system outlined in Cairn. Should you prefer a predefined list we turn you to our own game The Crypt Has Opened or Blades in the Dark.

### MONEY

Your currency solution is much like how you plan to handle equipment. Having a game that requires deep economic systems may require that the players know where every copper is coming from and where it is going.

If not then we suggest using an abstracted form of currency. Items can fall under one of four categories: Inexpensive, Valuable, Extravagant, and Priceless.

#### Buying Power

When using an abstracted currency system you’ll often need to know how much a character can purchase within a given day. Players are considered to be able to cover their standard equipment along with all inexpensive costs on a daily basis, within reason. Buying out a shop's entire inventory of inexpensive items would quickly become an extravagant or priceless cost when everything is added up.

A valuable item may be purchased once every other week per player and an extravagant item every 3 months per player. Players can elect to pool their resources together to decrease the wait time between purchases to whatever the Game Master feels is appropriate for the type of item and purchase location.

Priceless items may require an exchange of services or the right kind of persuasion to obtain. This should be reserved for fun story points.

### SKILLS

You may want to also include simple skills for your game as well. These are considered to be things like climbing, persuasion, or puzzle solving. Skills should never duplicate or be able to replicate Paths. If you find that your skills are able to do so, you may not need them at all.

#### Skill Die

This is like the character’s Level Die but always a d4 and can never be raised. This helps reinforce that the player’s Paths are far more suited to solving problems or overcoming obstacles than their skills. The player should be looking to their Paths first before resorting to a Skill.

That said, you may find that this doesn’t thematically work for your game. If so, ignore the Skill Die and allow the player to use their Level Die instead.

#### Skill Paths

A character has three Skill Paths: Mental, Physical, and Social. It follows the same process as the character’s main Paths. However, skills should be capped at a d8. This again reinforces that the player should be looking to their main Paths first.

#### Skill Aspects

These are the specific skills that your character has. You can have a predefined list of skills, or allow the players to come up with their own ideas that helps round out or tell us more about who their character is.

Whichever the case, these skills become Aspects of the three Skill Paths. Which of the three Paths the skill falls under should be rather intuitive. For instance, a skill in climbing would fall under the Physical Path. A skill like solving puzzles falls under Mental.

#### Skill Aptitude

Each Skill Aspect has a maximum of two Aptitude. Depending on the type of game you are running you may wish to lift this cap. Like the main Paths, the amount of Aptitude a character can have in any Aspect is limited by the associated Skill Path Die.

#### Starting Die and Aptitude

The three Skill Paths start at a d4. The players are given two upgrades to any of the three they wish, raising them from a d4 to a d6. Afterward we’ve found that 10 points of Aptitude to spread among the skills they choose makes for a very well rounded character.

## ADVANCEMENT

We learn more through our failures than through our successes. Each time a player fails a roll they gain a point of experience. This is to encourage players to use the full breadth of their character’s Paths despite not being as proficient in everythin. All Paths are available to overcome any given obstacle. So while the best Path for achieving a goal may not be a character’s strongest, there is a greater chance of gaining experience.

#### Spending XP

Player’s can spend their XP in a few different ways. Character Advancement or Story Beats. If your game has a town mechanic consider also allowing the players the ability to spend their collective experience to upgrade their town.

#### Character Advancement

To advance in a Path the player must spend a number of XP equal to the new Path Die’s level. Meaning to raise a Path from a d4 to a d6 would require two experience points. Going from a d6 to a d8, three points.

Likewise, gaining more Aptitude in an Aspect requires the player to spend that number of XP per point of Aptitude. However, a character’s Path Die limits how much Aptitude they can have. Meaning a d8 limits the character’s Aptitude to a max of 3 for all associated Aspects. In order to raise the cap, the player must first raise the Path’s Die level.

Once a character has upgraded three Paths to the next die level then their Level Die increases by one to a maximum of d12.
If you’re making a game with classes you may want to change it so that you just need a specific number of XP points to hit the next level.

#### Story Beats

At any time during a scene a player may spend 2 XP to make something true about a scene. Instead of asking the GM if there's a chandelier hanging above the opponent, they can spend 2 XP and make it true. Want there to be a shotgun behind the bar? For 2 XP it's there now.

#### Skill Advancement

You may wish for the players to be able to spend experience to raise their Skill Paths and Aptitude as outlined in Advancement or you may wish to give the players upgrades per Level Die advancement. Consider the themes and game mechanics you are trying to promote when picking your advancement method. Keeping this in mind should help you choose which one is right for your game.

# RUNNING THE GAME

## WHAT IS YOUR GOAL?

One of the greatest questions you have at your disposal as a GM is “What is your goal?” Oftentimes players have an intended goal but have difficulty expressing how they’re using their Paths and Skills to get what they want. If you’re ever unsure of what the player is after, simply ask them “What is your goal?” Such a direct question often helps them mentally refocus and find what they’re after. With a clearly stated goal you can help assist them finding the best method of achieving that goal.

## MANIPULATING IMPOSITION

#### Turning the Screws

A character’s ability to use Aptitude to lower Imposition is their greatest power. Which makes it their greatest pain point. As the GM there will be moments in the narrative where it will be appropriate to put the screws to the players, to lay on the difficulty. Nothing does this better than by manipulating their Aptitude.

You have two methods at your disposal; Constant and Irresistible Imposition. With these two tools in your shed you have the power to ratchet up the tension.

#### Constant Imposition

This particular type of Imposition is best used for situations were the narrative calls for an on going effect. Typically when a constant force is fighting against the player such as a headache or burdened by a lot of weight while attempting other tasks. A GM may find it necessary to impose one or more levels of Constant Imposition, depending on the narrative situation. This type of Imposition is applied before the player’s Aptitude is applied.

#### Irresistible Imposition

For when the task is reaching beyond the capacity of nature itself or pushing beyond the character’s capability a GM should reach for Irresistible Imposition. Aptitude has no power here. Irresistible Imposition quickly lets a player know just how far they're stretching their capabilities. Being completely denied access to one's Aptitude can feel oppressive. Which is why Irresistible Imposition should be left for narrative moments that need an appropriate punch. Resist the urge to apply this type of Imposition often. Using it too much diminishes its impact.

Like Constant Imposition, you may find it makes sense to apply only a few levels rather than denying a player's Aptitude altogether. You may tell the player that a task has two levels of Irresistible Imposition. This lets them know that they’ll need at least three points of Aptitude in order to lower the Imposition by one die level.

It can stack with Constant Imposition.

The best way to overcome Irresistible Imposition is for the player to spend Stress ([see Stress](#stress)).

#### All the same?

It may feel as if Constant and Irresistible Imposition are effectively the same thing. While they are similar there is a distinct difference between the two. Generally speaking, when a character is under Constant Imposition it is a force or entity that they can work to overcome to remove the encumbrance. Where as Irresistible Imposition will remain regardless of who is attempting the task or how many times it is tried. It represents an immutable truth that must be dealt with.

## PREPPING

It is highly encouraged that you do not overly prep for a game using the Imposition Dice System. The results of the dice can wildly change a scene and quickly move past your pre-written story. Like Apocalypse World says, “play to find out.” This is as much true for the players as the GM. Your job is to set obstacles in front of them and for everyone involved to play and see how they overcome those obstacles, how those obstacles may change over time, and how the characters change because of the outcomes.

Keeping “play to find out” in mind, our suggestion for prepping a game is to focus on what NPCs want and what they’ll do to get what they want. Your starting point is to pretend the PCs never arrive to interrupt an NPCs plan. What would happen?Then as the PCs interrupt those plans you only need to decide how the NPC will react. How will they adjust their plans? The players will then react to the new plan, forcing the NPC to once against adjust and react.

Do not attempt to preplan the NPC plan adjustments and reactions. This causes issues where your preplanned idea doesn’t match the current narrative being built by you and the players. The NPC’s reactions should logically follow the rude interruption of the PCs. Play to find out what the players are going to do and simply follow the next logical step.

This works on a per scene and per campaign scale. A bandit wants to capture the PCs in a net trap. When the PCs spot that trap, how does the bandit react? A mega-corporation wants to switch out an ingredient for a lesser one that’s known to cause a disease. When the PCs discover this secret, how does the mega-corporation react to being discovered?

## SEVERITY OF OUTCOME

Not only does the Imposition Die inform everyone on how difficult a task will be but it also gives an indication of how severe failure can be, how much a complication should set one back, or how amazing the success can be.
Consider a failure for the following example. Should the ID be low (a d4 or d6), that tells us the consequences would be a minor inconvenience. On the other hand, if it's a d12 your consequence may end up being major damage to you or a massive change to the landscape of the scene.

This is true for partial and full successes as well. For a partial success, the player should expect the severity of their consequence to depend on the level of the ID. The lower the ID, the less severe. Whereas a high ID may put the player at a major disadvantage on their next action or even for the remainder of the scene, despite the success.

For a full success, the ID will give an indication on just how spectacular the achievement is. On a low ID, they will have achieved exactly what they'd set out to do, but when a player succeeds beyond all odds against a high ID, then their success will be the stuff of legend.

In terms of partial successes, it is important to remember that regardless of how low or high the ID is, the complication should never undo that success, but add to the momentum of the narrative.

#### Major Wins & Losses

If you’d like, you can also include the chance for Major Wins and Losses. Should the Level and Path Die both be max value and the ID a minimum, this is a Major Win. The player’s outcome is extraordinary! However, if the opposite is true where the ID is max and the Level and Path are minimum then the player has rolled a Major Loss. This failure can bring catastrophic consequences. If you decide to include this, the player should receive 2 XP for a Major Loss.

#### Advantage & Disadvantage

Some games include an Advantage and Disadvantage system. For this type of mechanic the player rolls with Advantage should their Aptitude lower the ID below a d4. In this circumstance have them roll 2d4 and take the lower outcome. For Disadvantage do the opposite. Should Constant Imposition drive the ID above a d12, have the player roll 2d12 and take the higher outcome.

It has been my experience that Disadvantage isn’t necessary. a d12 ID is often enough to be a challenge on its own.

## NARRATIVE CONFRONTATION

At its base the Imposition Dice System does not use the term combat. While scenes can turn violent, it is preferential to use the term confrontation. This is helpful in breaking the mindset that all confrontation must be solved with violence. While some characters may result to that, others may have abilities geared toward a non-violent resolution within the same scene and should feel encouraged to pursue those options.

There is also no initiative in the base system. Where your typical RPG breaks out into a separate form of play by splitting time into rounds and the players and GM roll dice to determine who acts in what order, here we use Popcorn Initiative. Simply follow the confrontational flow, the narrative, to determine who acts when.

There should be no meaningful separation between when the players are roleplaying, where characters are talking with NPCs or perhaps investigating a mystery, and when things turn physically confrontational.

That isn't to say even these less combative scenes can't lead to harm ([see Health And Damage](#health-and-damage)). Certainly, there are all types of harm, both physical and mental, that can happen in any situation.

### WHAT IS A SCENE

Much like any movie, tv show, or book a scene generally takes place in a single location and focuses on a specific goal or set of actions performed by the player characters. It could encompass just a few minutes of in game time or several hours. Scenes are moments of roleplaying between PCs or between PCs and NPCs that push the story forward. Haggling with a shop owner to get a better deal on some equipment would be a scene. Exploring an abandoned City Hall or rooting our rats from a tavern’s basement is another scene that may have its own moments of roleplaying. Scenes flow with a natural beginning, middle, and end.

### CONFRONTATIONAL FLOW

A confrontational scene should feel as much like any other scene. Or perhaps it should be said that a scene blurs the lines between exploring, roleplaying, and confrontation. There should be an attempt to maintain a seamless narrative between all three within the same scene. Everything flows out from the narrative. When does a player act? When do the NPCs act? Whenever the group and GM feels it makes most sense and supports the narrative.

During a confrontational scene where there is violence or great tension, each player should have a moment to describe their action and attempt a roll to see if it takes effect. What order they take those actions in is up to the group. Always bear in mind the phrase, "everything flows out from the narrative." This mindset should start a conversation between the players and the Game Master.

What exactly does it mean to flow out from the narrative? Simply put, it means that character actions should make sense within the context of the scene and in reaction to the dice outcomes.

Everyone at the table is building a story with highs and lows, reacting to how the dice shift the story. The flow is finding the rhythm in the scene and the specific confrontation. Draw inspiration from your favorite novels, television shows, or movies. In most scenes, each character gets their moment to help push the narrative forward with their actions. There is a gentle give and take between each player and Game Master that lets everyone shine and that builds a Confrontational Flow.

### ACTING OUT OF TURN

A part of failure and success with consequences is that the NPCs act or react "out of turn." Essentially, the Severity of Outcome will often determine when this is the case. It may be that your attack is blocked followed by a counter attack, inflicting a level or levels of harm based on the initial ID. Your attempt at persuasion may have brought up bad memories in the NPC, making them angrier.

This method of controlling NPCs helps in violent confrontations to solve the issue of the characters ganging up on one main antagonist to overwhelm them without any danger to themselves.

### HEALTH AND DAMAGE

For health we take inspiration from Blades in the Dark. The character has six health boxes. Three Minor wounds, two Medium, and one Major. Whenever they take some form of physical harm the player will write the specific type of harm they received in a box that the Game Master asks for. For instance the character could have received a laceration on their forearm after a bad roll on a climb check. Depending on on the ID of the climb check, the Game Master could give them a level or levels of harm ranging from Minor to Major. The player would then write lacerated forearm in the box(s). This is necessary for any future actions that may require that arm. Say the character is hanging from a ledge. Maybe normally there would be no issue at all, but with the injured arm it now has become an interesting question. Can the player maintain their grip with the injured arm? Or if the entire party is climbing across a perilous rope bridge, the check for that player may be higher than the others.

The damage boxes are set into three columns. Whenever all boxes of a column are filled in the character suffers a reduction in Aptitude. That reduction is a -1 for all Minor, -2 for all Medium, and a -3 for a Major wound.

#### Alternative

##### Health

You could opt for a more traditional health pool. How you determine a character’s health can be determined in a number of ways. It could be the value of their Level Die, meaning a d6 character would have 6 hit points, or perhaps a Path could handle character hit points by being the value of the Path Die.

You could also either multiply the value or die step by an amount that fits your setting. So a Path Die of a d4, multiplied by 2 would be either 8 hit points or 2, respectively. The choice is going to be whatever helps support the themes and goals of your game.

##### Damage

Enemy damage would work much the same way as health. An opponent would deal an amount of damage either equal to the value of their Level Die or equal the die’s step. This would mean that a d8 opponent could either deal 8 points of damage or 3 respectively. The choice will largely depend on how you’ve determined character hit points. I would suggest keeping them the same method for consistency and to make it easier to judge just how dangerous an opponent is to the PCs.

## ENEMY DESIGN

All NPCs are broken down to their Level Die, Threat Die, and then any special abilities and lore information they may have. Don’t feel the need to do this for every potential NPC the characters may encounter. Only for those that pose a significant threat. For everyone else you only need to know their Level Die. Knowing this die level is all you’ll need for when a character attempts any action that may have fun or interesting consequences.

### LEVEL DIE

Knowing an NPC’s Level Die tells you everything you need to know about them. How much damage they’ll inflict in a violent confrontation ([see both Severity of Outcome](#severity-of-outcome) and [Health AND Damage](#health-and-damage)), how many hits they can take before being taken out, how hard they are to persuade, or even what it may take to keep them from doing something to you!

Hits can mean many different things in a scene. For instance, an opponent with a d6 Level Die will fall after taking 6 hits, which narratively speaking may mean physical hits, persuading them, stopping their villainous activities, etc. You may raise or lower this number depending on how weak or tough you want the NPC to be.

The NPC may also have key specialties that could be higher than their own Level Die. A master spy may only be a d6 overall, but a d10 when it comes to infiltration or lying.

### THREAT DIE

NPCs may also tap into their ability to threaten a PC or NPCs directly. The Threat Die allows them to add more Imposition against a PC, effectively adding Constant Imposition. This could be two chess masters, where the opponent (the NPC) is focusing their Threat (onto the PC).

This die isn’t rolled, but rather shows how many “steps” the opponent can increase the Imposition. Meaning an NPC with a d4 Threat Die can increase the Imposition against one PC by an additional Die Level. If the NPC has a d6 Threat Die, they could either increase the Imposition by two levels against one PC or by one level against two, and so on.

### NPC FORMAT

**Level Die:** Ranging from a d4 to a d12, this is the starting Imposition Level that the PC must overcome in order to affect them with anything.

**Threat Die:** This die represents the general threat they can assert over the PCs. An NPC can lower their Threat Die in order to raise a PC's ID. This is a Constant Imposition.

**Lore:** This is all the known information about the NPC. It is up to the GM to determine if all, some, or none of this is true. Expand or alter this information to best fit with your game's needs.

**Special Ability [Name]:** These are generally one-time powers or skills that give them an edge in a conflict. They may affect multiple opponents, deal above average affects, have an increased ID over what the NPC's normal Level Die is, or perform some other feat that is beyond what a PC can do.

**Motivation:** This section briefly goes over what may motivate this NPC on a day-to-day basis. Use this as a springboard for its actions and how they may fit into your story.

**GM Notes:** This is any relevant, non-lore information. You'll find their strengths and weaknesses and suggestions on how to use the NPC. Remember, these are suggestions and a way to show the original intent behind the NPC but change what you need to make it fit your game.

Finally, NPCs do not have damage boxes as they do not have Aptitude.

# GAMEPLAY LOOP

Your gameplay loop will largely depend on the themes and goals of the characters. For a traditional dungeon crawling game, your loop will be to discover the location of an interesting dungeon, explore it for treasure and secrets, return to town to spend your goods, repeat.

However, for more slice of life style games, you’ll most likely be focusing on the fallout of confrontations, leaning toward the roleplaying moments. For our college wrestling scenario you may find a loop like this: Practice for the match, Match, Deal with the fallout of the win or loss, repeat.

Finding distinct locations and scenes that your game will move through (the gameplay loop) can help you lock in what types of Paths you’ll need for your game, how you’ll handle hit points, and what kind of equipment if any you’ll want to use.

# MAKING AN IMPOSITION GAME

## RECAP

#### Themes & Goals

Making an Imposition Dice game is about establishing your themes first. Determine the goals you want the players to pursue and how the gameplay loop can help facilitate achieving those goals.

#### Paths & Aspects

Once you’ve nailed those down you’ll have a solid idea of what kinds of Paths you’ll need for your game and the Aspects associated with them. While our examples use five Paths with three Aspects each, you may find that yours will need more or fewer. It is not wrong either way. Do what will fit best for your game. If you do deviate from this default, keep in mind how that may adjust the starting Aptitude points your character will need to make them feel competent without being overpowered early on.

#### Character Options

Classes, Playbooks, or Freeform will have large impacts on the game. Always be true to the themes and making the choice of how to handle character options should be easy. Even still, be open to adjusting your theme if you find that the character options are speaking to you and guiding you in a direction that you find more appealing.

You may find that having skills on top of Paths is largely unnecessary. Or perhaps your game is only skills. Do you need special abilities? That answer to that is most likely dependent on how spectacular or heroic you want the game to feel. Character options can drastically change the tone of your game.

#### Everything Else

Like a broken record, whether you have equipment and money and how they’re handled is all going to be dependent upon your theme’s and character goals. The more important they are to them the more involved and robust you will want them to be mechanically or how they interact and impact the player experience.

For the college wrestling example we’ve used, equipment and money are probably unnecessary and can be ignored entirely. However, an adventuring party of dungeoneers may need to know how much they can carry, where their items are stored, and how they can impact a scene.
