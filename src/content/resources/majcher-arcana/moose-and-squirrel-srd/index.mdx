# Moose & Squirrel SRD

Words, development, and PbMaS logo by Marc Majcher / Majcher Arcana

# Introduction

Powered by Moose and Squirrel (or PbMaS) is a system reference document created to help people make games inspired by TSR’s **Bullwinkle and Rocky Roleplaying Party Game** (long title!), originally published in 1988. That’s the year I graduated high school—I was mostly playing D&D and Battletech and Car Wars and Marvel Super Heroes back then, and had no idea that this was even a thing. Recently, however, the game has popped up in a few places in my Extremely Online™ RPG spaces, and I had to find out what it was all about.

Friends, this game is great.

We’re not here to talk about how great that game is, though. We’re here to take a scalpel and forceps and an MRI machine and some of those clicky-clacky things that look kind of like scissors but they’re more like really long clamps, and we’re going to pull the innards out of that beautiful beast and pin them to a museum display board for future generations to study.

**(That’s a lot of text to read! What’s going on here, again?)**

What’s going on here is that you can use this document to make your own comedic story-telling roleplaying games. Or whatever you like. That’s all.

There are two types of “Games” described in here: the “Narration Game”, and the “Everyone Plays a Character Game”. The first is lighter and requires less investment from players, but they’re both pretty simple and fun, and you can slide right from one into the other. Just add your own theme and go!

By the way, if we ever need to reference characters, **Ramjet the Squirrel** and **Larry the Moose** are the only moose and squirrel we’re going to talk about here. There are other, more famous squirrels and meese out there, of course, but they are under copyright until the year 2055. (_Impotent fist shake at Disney!_)

You can’t do anything with this SRD that would be damaging to Majcher Arcana or Marc Majcher’s image or reputation. (Like, for real, I don’t think you could, even if you tried. But don’t try.)

If you have to ask if this includes you, take a good long look in the mirror, because it probably does.

# The Bits and Pieces (stuff you’ll need)

In a roleplaying game (or storytelling game, or party game, or whatever you want to call it), all of the real action happens in our imaginations, so you’d think you don’t need much outside your noggin. Hoo, buddy, would you be wrong!

Most “regular” roleplaying games use character sheets, and dice, and pencils and paper, and slide rules, and all that nerd stuff. Well, this game is not regular. (It’s irregular, even!) But you do need to put some stuff together for it, and since I assume you’re reading this because you want to design a PbMaS game, you’re going to be the poor chump building all the bits and pieces that other people will be playing with. So, here’s some things that we’re going to use here:

## The Story Book

This is the book that has all the stories in it! But wait just a minute there, if you’re going to be making up stories while you’re playing the game, they shouldn’t be all written out ahead of time—this isn’t the Dragon Game, right?

Right! But there are some important things in here. First off, the kinds of stories that you put in the Story Book are one of the main things that will set the tone of your game, and give the players a good idea of what kind of stuff they should be shooting for, story-wise.

But we’re not writing the whole thing out, we’re just giving them the important parts, so the players have something to work with, and they’re not forced to come up with something amazing off the tops of their heads. To that end, each story in the Story Book will contain several important parts:

- **The Introduction**: This sets up the beginning of the story, the “once upon a time” stuff, so everyone knows where they should start off. The players should be able to read this right out of the book to kick things off.
- **The Ending**: What? You’re going to give away how the story ends? You bet! With the beginning and end all sorted out, the players are free to do whatever they like in the middle, without worrying about messing anything up. (This is only used in the \*Narration Game\*\*.)
- **Characters**: This tells the players which characters (see below) should appear in the story. If there are teams, make sure that there are some characters from each team in there! Any character not in this list can still show up in the story, and if someone really really wants to, they can play someone not on the list, but buckle up, because it’s gonna get wacky.
- **Goals**: These are only used in the _Everyone Can Play A Character Game_. Each group of characters (like, “The Good Guys”, “The Bad Guys”, “The Martians”, “The Delegation From the South Pole”, and so on) will have a particular ending that they’re shooting for. Whichever character or group of characters achieves their goal by using their last card wins! (you’ll see)
- **Some Great Ideas**: These are bits of business or situations or Lazzi (if you want to get fancy) that you can incorporate into the story if you don’t have any good ideas. You don’t _have_ to use them, but they’re right there!

## The Cards

This is a deck of cards that contains all the elements you’d like the players to potentially work into their stories. The standard number for a deck of Story Cards is 108 (for lots of reasons, but mostly because it’s a really nice number), but you can always make more or less, depending on your game and how industrious you’re feeling.

Each card should have text on it describing the story element to be included in the tale: “A Plate of Waffles”, “The Colossus of Rhodes”, “An Old-Timey Carriage Full of Seals”, “Relentlessness”, “The Color Yellow”, “Your Mom (Who Is A Very Nice Lady”, and so on. They can be as specific or as abstract as you like, but they should probably include a bunch of setting elements from the subject of your game, you know, because that’s why they’re there.

Pictures are really nice to have on the cards, too. I’m not gonna tell you that you’re required, because not everyone has access to amazing art, but I bet whatever you can come up with is going to be fantastic. (Or hey, if you want to use something like tarot cards, or a Lenormand deck, or loteria cards, go for it!)

## Spinners

Okay, stay with me here. You know how I said that this game doesn’t use dice or anything, right? Well... kind of. Here’s the thing. The original boxed set of the game that this SRD is based on has a bunch of spinners that you put together, each with an odd number of “Yes” or “No” spaces on them. They’re really neat! Each character that you’d play in the game has their own spinner, with their own unique chances of getting a “Yes” or “No” result. Super neat, right?

I don’t know where you’d get your own spinners, but if you’re able to do that, heck yeah, go for it! I think it adds a lot to the feel of the game, but really, use whatever method of randomization you think fits. That could be rolling dice, where each character has a range that’s “Yes” or “No” for them, drawing cards to do the same, or whatever you like. The important thing is, most of them had a way bigger chance of hitting “No” than “Yes”! Like, 50-90% of the spaces were “No”—that’s a lot! But never fear, failing is all part of the fun...

## Character Standees

Yeah. Okay, this is another thing. I said no character sheets, but honestly, these are kind of like the character sheets for this game. The good thing is, you don’t have to write anything on them or keep track of stuff with them!

Again, in the original game, there were cool cardboard stand-ups with drawings of the characters on the front—along with their name, just in case you weren’t familiar with everyone. Like the spinners, these seem pretty Extra, but they’re also really cool! You see, every character has a set of two to four Powers that they can use to affect the story, some which happen automatically, and some that you need to spin for. Well, these powers are all listed on the back of the standee, so you always have them right in front of you! They also have a short list of quotes that the character might say, in case you can’t think of anything.

The Narrator has their own special microphone standee with all their rules and principles and stuff on it, but we’ll talk about that in the Everybody Plays a Character Game, because that’s where those come into play.

## Certificates

These are handouts that the players can fill out at the end of the game to reward (or gently rib) the other players for their performance! These could be certificates of merit, diplomas (like in the original), promotions, museum plaques, medals, funny business cards, whatever you like. Put enough on these to give them flavor, but leave plenty of room for folks to make stuff up.

## Puppets (!!!!)

Yes, there are hand puppets in the original moose and squirrel game. No, they have no mechanical effect, but they are super sweet to use when you’re playing out stories with those characters. If you want to add some extra meat on those puppetly bones, go right ahead, and let us (who?) know what you come up with!

### **(Is That It?)**

I think so! On to the games!

# The Narration Game

The object of this game is simply to tell a story. Don’t bother writing a “What is a Roleplaying Game?” section or anything—everyone knows how to tell a story, so everybody gets to be the Narrator! The Narration Game is cooperative, not competitive, so everyone’s just here to have a good time.

You can think of this as an “introductory” game, or you can just play it and not worry about exactly what category everything has to be in, jeez.

## The Story Book

The first thing you’ll need is a Story Book. This is a book that contains a selection of story scaffolds to choose from, tailored to whatever theme or genre your game works in.

All the players will decide upon a story to tell together (or if it’s your game, you get to pick whatever you like, and they can argue about what to get on the pizza or something). Whichever person wants to can read aloud The Introduction and The Ending of the story. That’s right, you start already knowing how the story ends! **Innovative!**

## The Cards

The second thing you’ll need is a deck of Story Cards. We (we who?) recommend 108 cards, because it’s such a nice number, but you can do however many you can manage. These cards each have a story element written on them, like “Thunderstorm”, “Betrayal”, “Free Trip to Bermuda”, or “Larry’s 1975 Dodge Dart”. Pictures to go along with the words are always nice—if you’re not a drawer, there are [plenty](https://game-icons.net/) of [places](https://thenounproject.com/) to get [nice things](https://unsplash.com/images/stock/public-domain) to put on them.

To begin, you’ll deal five cards to each player (or four cards, if five or more people are playing). After everyone’s heard the story’s Introduction and Ending, they can discard as many cards as they like from their hand and draw new ones—but you might want to encourage them to keep ones that they think might not fit, because **comedy**.

## The Story

Once everyone’s got their cards all settled and sorted, the player responsible for all of this begins the game. (**The Narrator!**) They start by telling the story from the beginning, as described in the Introduction, and continue by adding a bit onto it, inspired by one of the cards in their hand. Once they work the person, place, or thing (nouns!) on their card into the story, they’ll lay down their card on the table.

Once the card’s played, the player on their left can jump in any time, taking on the mantle of Narrator and continuing the story. Eventually the new Narrator will play a card from their hand, incorporating that story element into the tale. Then the player on their left can interrupt and become Narrator, and so on around the table.

(How a player uses their cards is pretty much up to them and the good graces of the table, but there should be some connection between what they narrate and what’s on their card. Dad jokes and bad puns are super valid here, but you can make your game work however you like. There are no hard and fast rules here, just remember—be cool, man.)

If for some reason a player just can’t get their brain together enough to work one of their cards into the story (don’t worry, it happens to all of us), they can discard as many cards as they like and draw their hand back up to five cards—new cards can be played immediately, if they like!

## The End

Continue the story, going around the table and passing around the Narrator role—in the original game, there was a cool microphone standee, but you can use a card, or nothing, or whatever works for your game. When every player is down to just one card, anyone who wants to can trade in their last card for a new one from the deck. Then it’s _STORY SHOWDOWN_.

When everyone’s ready (don’t be cute about this, just be cool), the responsible player will count to three. On “Three!”, every player throws their last card down on the table. Then flip over the stack (or terrible mess), and the player whose card winds up on the bottom (that is, the player who was fastest on the draw) gets to end the story using whatever’s on that card.

Remember, this is a cooperative story-telling game, so don’t throw down just for the sake of winning. If someone is crowing that they’ve got the perfect card for the ending, let them have it, and if it turns out they were wrong, well...

Once the story has been brought to an end (one that matches The Ending set out in the Story Book, right?), the game is over. Now it’s time for goodies!

## Certificates

When the game is done, everyone gives out awards to the other players. They can be promotions, diplomas, certificates of merit, gift cards to fake restaurants, whatever works for your game. Give the players some structure, but give them space to fill in their own titles: “Best Reporting”, “Worst Punster”, “Doctor of WTF”, “Best Ending of All Time”, and so on. Good vibes all around.

In the Narration game, these certificates are just for fun—the EPaCG makes them count for something, so enjoy them while you can!

# The Everybody Plays a Character Game

Okay, this is exactly like the Narration Game, only totally different. In the Narration Game, everyone plays the role of the Narrator and just tells a story like a normal storyteller would. In the Everybody Plays a Character Game, though, everybody... um... plays a character. And takes turns playing the Narrator. And... well, you’ll see.

## Setup

Okay, okay, we talked about a lot of this in the Narration game, so I’m mostly going to just tell you about the bits that are different—and there's a lot!

First off, you’ll start very much the same way as in the Narration Game. Get folks together and pick a story from the Story Book. But wait! Now you get to pick who you want to play from the list of characters in the story you chose! Take a look at the available characters (or any of them, if you want to live dangerously) and pick the one that you like the best. Or the one that’s left over because you took too long to decide.

Take that character’s standee or card or however you make it work, and put that in front of you. That’s you now! Look at you! You’re also going to need the spinner (if you’re using spinners) and puppet (come on, use puppets!) for your character and keep them nearby.

Once you’ve got your characters, review the Goals for you and your team in the chosen story. This is how you want the story to end in order to win, so make sure you angle the story in that direction!

When everyone’s settled, deal out five cards (or four, if there are more than five players) to everyone, and give the microphone standee to the person you’d like to start off as Narrator. They'll read the Introduction of the story out loud to everyone, and you’re off!

## Playing Characters

Remember how in the Narration game, anyone could say anything about anything, and make any character do whatever they want whenever they want? Well, in the Everybody Plays A Character Game, everybody... plays a character! That means that whoever’s playing that character has final say over what they do and say—nobody else can make them do or say something you don’t want them to! (Mostly...)

There will, of course, be plenty of characters in your story that aren’t controlled by a single player—you can call those “NPCs” or “Side Characters” or whatever you like, and any player can say how they behave and how they act. You can bring them in at will, using a card if you like, but that’s not required.

As we talked about in the Bits and Pieces section, each character has their own spinner (or range of probabilities, or table you roll on, or whatever) that says how likely it is to get a “Yes” or “No” answer when they’re called to spin for something. Try to keep the numbers to a minimum, so people don’t feel like they’re working on a spreadsheet or something, but do what you need to do.

Each character also has a set of special Powers or abilities that they can (or must!) use when they’re playing in the story. Some are good, some are bad, and some are just there. Your standee (or card, or character sheet, etc) will have those Powers written on the back so you can easily reference them. Some work automatically (for better or worse), and some will require a spin (or roll or card pull, you get the idea, I’m gonna stop now), and they should always clearly say which, ideally right next to the cool name you gave them. (Note: playing a Power will always beat a card that someone plays, so use them wisely!)

How and when can you use those powers? Well:

- You can use your power whenever the power says you can. (obvs, yeah)
- You can always use your power when the Narrator asks you a question.

Did we really need a bulleted list for two things? Probably not. Am I going to change that? Also probably not.

Remember: whenever you play a card or use one of your Powers, the Narrator takes control of the story again, asking questions and whatnot. (Unless they forget, then get away with whatever you can until they remember!)

## The Fickle Finger of Fate

So, about those spinners. The chances of getting a “Yes” when you spin should not be very high, in general. In the original game, the odds of getting a “No” ranged from the (rare) 50/50, to 10 times out of 11 (91%!!). Feel free to tailor this to your game, but make sure it’s a linear distribution—less fancily, don’t add dice together or anything, just make it a straight spin or roll or however you do.

(Players can also always choose the “No” or the bad result of a spin without actually spinning, if they think it might be more interesting or funny or good for the story to do so!)

Okay, so, if you want to win, and spinning has a good chance of making you fail, you don’t want to spin if you can help it, right? So when do you _have_ to spin? How about another nice bulleted list?

- Spin whenever your character’s power says that you have to.
- Spin whenever your character tries to do something that affects another character.
  - (If they’re trying to stop you, you might have to do a SPIN OFF!)
- Spin whenever your character tries to do something out of the ordinary (for them), dangerous, scary, risky, or any other time when failure might be interesting or funny. (This is usually up to the Narrator.)
- Spin whenever the Narrator tells you to. (Hey!)
- Spin when you play your last card to try to end the story.
- Have a SPIN OFF! when you and another player both play a card in order to do something to each other.

That seems like a lot to keep track of, but that’s mostly the Narrator’s job, so don’t worry about it too much. I mean, unless you’re the Narrator. Which you will be at some point, probably. Definitely. Just wait...

**SPIN OFF!** A SPIN OFF! just means that both players spin their spinners—if one gets a “Yes” and the other gets a “No”, the “Yes” player wins, and gets to do what they wanted to do. If they both get a “No”, they both fail in some hilarious way. If they both get a “Yes”, they both do the thing, which is probably even messier than failing, and therefore more hilarious.

## When Things Go Wrong

So, you failed a spin (or chose to fail) and now something bad is going to happen. (This is me sitting down on a chair backwards to do some straight shooting with you.) What exactly does that mean?

That means (all together!) that the Narrator decides what happens to you!

Whoa, that seems like a lot of power to put in the hands of one player! Especially when they’ll also be playing a character in the story! Well, yeah, that’s the idea. If you’re the Narrator, and something bad happens to someone on the other team, feel free to make it as bad as you want. If they’re on your team, though, you still get to decide—they still have to fail, but maybe it won’t be so bad? But remember, your turn to get yours will be coming soon, so... just be cool, man. Always try to err on the side of being funny, not mean.

Okay, but really, what kind of bad things can happen? Well, this is a cartoony comedy game, so nothing _that_ bad. (Your game’s theme or tone may differ, so these are more guidelines than “rules”.)

First off, you can’t kill off or seriously injure a character that someone’s playing. (Side Characters, though...) The worst thing you can really do is temporarily remove them from the scene in a fictionally appropriate way—that is, if they get blown up, maybe they just go flying off-screen for a while, or get covered with soot and have their beak spin around until they can get their feathers back on properly. Not so bad, right?

When you’re out of a scene like that, you can’t play cards, advance the story, or work to achieve your goals. Any other player can bring back your character, though, by introducing them back into the story somehow, and if nobody thinks to do that, you get to come back in automatically when the Narrator role passes to another player. (Whaaaaaaat?)

# The Narrator

Yes, that’s right, the Narrator role moves around in this game, just like in the Narration game! Well, okay, not _just_ like.

When someone’s character gets into trouble—most of the time as the result of a bad spin—the Narrator has to think of a funny or interesting way to get them out of it. If they can’t think of anything (or they just want to ditch a card), they can play a card from their hand and incorporate that into the story in order to get the player out of trouble. (Or into different trouble, at least.)

But! When the Narrator plays a card, they have to pass the Narrator role to the player on their left—just hand over the microphone or card or Startspieler token or whatever, and now _they’re_ the boss! The previous Narrator still gets to play their regular character, of course. This way, everyone will get to be the Narrator at some time during the game, and bask in their Limitless Power!

Speaking of power, let’s talk about the powers, and because great power, the responsibilities of the Narrator. (These will also be on the microphone standee or card, for easy reference for Narrators with a goldfish-like memory like me.)

**When you become the Narrator**: If you want to, draw one card, and then discard one card from your hand. You don’t have to, but it’s cool either way.

**Ask Questions**: It’s your job to keep the story moving, and players can only do things when you ask them questions, so do that a lot. Fortunately, there’s a big list of questions you can always ask on the Narrator card or microphone standee! Your game will probably have some questions specific to the setting, but some good go-to ones are:

- Where is your character, and what are they doing?
- Tell me more about how they’re doing that?
- What does this place look like? Give me some details!
- Whoa, are you going to let them get away with that?
- How are you going to stop that from happening?
- Do you want to use a Power? Do you want to play a card?
- What’s the worst thing that could happen right now?
- What are you going to do?
- And so on...

**Tell Them to Spin**: Remember, you’re the final word when it comes to players spinning to see if they do a thing or not, or if their power works. You get to make people spin or roll whenever:

- They do something that’s unusual, risky, scary, dangerous, or something that might fail in an interesting way.
- They try to do something to someone else’s character.
- There’s a disagreement between players about what happens.
- Or any other time you think they should. (The Power!)

**Describe Stuff**: Since players only describe things when you ask them to, it’s up to you to fill in a lot of stuff yourself! You get to say what happens as the result of someone playing a card (successfully or not), as the result of a spin, and as the result of any choices the players might make. It’s not your responsibility to handle _everything_ in the story, but it’s up to you to keep things moving, bub.

**Pass the Mic**: Any time you play a card, whether it’s because of something your character does, or because you chose to put down a card as an inspiration for how to get someone’s character out of a pickle when they fail a spin, your time as Narrator is up. After you play that card, pass your microphone standee or Narrator card to the player on your left—you’re back to only playing your own character, but it’ll come back around to you soon!

**In Summary**, as Narrator, your job is to:

- Ask the other players questions and find out what they want to do.
- Keep the story moving towards the ending in the Story Book.
- Make the other players spin for stuff, and make bad things happen to them when they fail!

Also remember that when you’re the Narrator, you’re still playing your own character just like everyone else is! Yes, that means that you might be asking yourself questions and giving answers back to yourself, but we all do that sometimes, so it’s no big deal, right? Everyone does that, yeah? Okay.

And if you can’t remember all that, no worries—that’s why it’s all written down!

## Character Goals and How To Win

All right, telling stories is nice and everything, but this is a **game**! How do I **win**?

Unlike the Narration Game, the EPaCG is competitive, not cooperative. Every character or team of characters has a different goal they want to achieve to end the story and win the game. If you’re on the Bad Guys team, and some other Bad Guy plays their last card and spins well and wins, then you win, too! Hooray for the Bad Guys!

All you need to do is get rid of all your cards, then use whatever’s on your last card to describe how you achieve your goal, then **spin your spinner**. If you get a “Yes”, then sweet, you win! If you get a “No”, however, the game is still on, and you’ll have to find another way to reach your story goal—draw back as many cards as you want, up to your hand limit (at least one!) and keep playing!

Okay, so, you can’t win unless you play all the cards in your hand, so how do you get rid of those things? (Oh no, another tiny list incoming!) Two ways:

- Play one to get someone out of trouble when you’re the Narrator.
- Play one to do something related to what’s on the card without spinning, or incorporate that thing into the story somehow.

That’s it! Answer the Narrator’s questions, and get creative with your stuff!

## Certificates and “Experience”

After the game is won, it’s time to give your fellow storytellers rewards in the form of certificates, just like in the Narration game! (If you’re familiar with the practice of giving Stars and Wishes after a game, it’s kind of like that.)

_Unlike_ the Narration Game, certificates are actually worth something here! After you get your certificates or whatever other rewards you want to give out, hang on to them to use in the next Everybody Plays a Character Game!

Here’s how they work:

- You can cash in two certificates to get an extra spin, if you don’t like the result (probably a “No”) that you just got.
- You can cash in five certificates to win a spin without spinning! (Unfortunately, you can’t use this one on a spin to win the game, sorry.)

That’s it for the standard version—if you want to add more things to your own PbMaS game, go for it!

## RECAP

That’s way more stuff than I thought it would be. Well, more words, anyway—the game itself is pretty simple, it just gets confusing when an old windbag like me tries to explain the rules. So, in summary, here’s the main gist of it:

- Pick a story, pick characters, deal out cards.
- The Narrator reads the Introduction and endings/goals to everyone.
- The Narrator asks questions to the other players, and they answer.
- Stuff happens! Describe things, play cards, spin spinners, go hog wild.
- When the Narrator plays a card, the role passes to their left.
- Steer the story towards your goal, then play your last card and spin to see if you did the thing. If you did, woohoo, you win!
- Certificates for everyone! Yay!

I guess I could have just written that to start with, but, oh well. Have fun!

## OTHER STUFF

[Safety tools](https://slyflourish.com/safety_tools.html) are a thing. Find the ones you like, and use them! (I tend to prefer using some combination of the Open Door Policy, Lines and Veils, and some kind of Script Change/X-Card/OK Check In, but talk about it with your group, and use whatever works for you!)

There’s... a lot of stuff in the source material that the original Moose and Squirrel game was based on. Like, _stuff_. That was a product of its time, and all that, yadda yadda—just make sure that whatever kind of story you’re telling is respectful to folks of all kinds, and you’ll be okay. **Just be cool, man.**

I’m sure there’s more. If I missed something, let me know—I’m sure that I’ll be updating and revising this document as we discover new stuff together!

First and foremost, [The Bullwinkle and Rocky Roleplaying Party Game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1611/bullwinkle-and-rocky-role-playing-party-game) (whew!) by David Cook and Warren Spector, published by TSR. It’s a pity this one didn’t become the big mainstream RPG instead of the dragon game, but oh well.

Epidiah Ravachol, for his original [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/Epidiah/status/1158386626315411456) that inspired this whole thing.
