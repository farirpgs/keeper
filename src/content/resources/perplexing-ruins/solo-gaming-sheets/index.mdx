# Introduction

> A project I initially developed to help consolidate my solo gaming. I want to minimize the paper, the books, the cards, whatever else.
>
> I also wanted something portable.
>
> These two sheets (printed front to back) offer a way to game with a small footprint. Use a phone dice roller, and it fits on plane tray, hotel desk, on the cover of a magazine at the doctor's office, in bed with a small lamp.
>
> These sheets comprise of numerous tables to generate a game narrative, and to see it grow!
>
> There are monsters by terrain included. There are encounters, oracles, settlement creators, dungeon morphs. Loot tables, a list of bosses, dressing tables. It's all there!
>
> The sheets have stats compatible with Old School D&D. White Box and Swords & Wizardry fit with these.
>
> Now includes a printable Campaign Booklet to record more in depth play sessions!
>
> To Print: Double-Sided, flip on Short Edge. To Fit.
