# Pre-game Discussion | Introductions

Before starting your game, it is advisable to have a discussion with your fellow Players and Guide, about things both in and out of game.

## Playing Safely

Before starting any TTRPG, it is important to take measures that ensure the safety and respect of all Players.

Generally speaking, it is important that all Players let each other know beforehand what subject matter and themes they would prefer only be alluded to or not covered at all during the game. How serious should the game’s tone be? Should Character death be an option?

The ultimate goal of Four Points, like most TTRPGs, is for the Players to tell an enjoyable story together and have fun. The Guide and other Players therefore have a responsibility towards each other to determine what tone the game will have, and whether or not everyone playing is comfortable with that tone.

This can be facilitated through the use of a variety of Safety Tools (see link below).

_[The TTRPG Safety Toolkit Guide](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/114jRmhzBpdqkAlhmveis0nmW73qkAZCj)_, collected and curated by Kienna Shaw (@/KiennaS) and Lauren Bryant-Monk (@/jl_nicegirl)

# Core Rules | Mechanics

This section covers the rules of the Four Points RPG System.

Four Points is so named because it focuses on four main concepts: Player Agency, Narrative, Characters and Customisation.

Like in most other table-top roleplaying games, there are Players, who interpret the roles of Characters within the fictional setting of the game. One of the Players is the Guide, who also interprets Characters – the Non-Player Characters or NPCs – and generally functions as referee and narrator. This Player is referred to as a Guide in this document, but can have any genre-appropriate name (Story-Teller, Lore-keeper, Navigator, etc.).

Four Points is setting neutral, which means it does not come with a pre-written setting and can be used to run games in any genre of world you want, from fantasy to science-fiction, from horror to period melodrama.

It also functions as a tool-kit, providing a selection of options for building both Characters and settings, with lots of room for customisation and collaboration. If you are planning on running a Four Points game as a Guide, see the Guide Section.

## Actions | Mechanics

Actions are things your Character does, the consequences of which are important to the game.

There are two ways of performing Actions: by spending **Energy Points** (EP) from a Stat Pool, or by **Testing your Luck**.

### Spending EP

To perform an Action, you can spend EP from one of your Stat pools.

Your Character has four **Stats**:

- **Wits**, which covers things like wisdom, intelligence and knowledge.
- **Stamina**, which covers things like strength, endurance and determination.
- **Dexterity**, which covers things like speed, agility and coordination.
- **Sociability**, which covers things like confidence, charm and charisma.

The amount of EP you spend will determine how successful you are in your Action.

You must spend EP from the Stat pool most relevant to the kind of Action you wish to perform. For example, trying to break down a locked door will probably cost some EP from your Stamina pool, whereas trying to convince a city guard to let you pass will require EP from your Sociability pool. When you run out of Energy Points in all four Stat pools, you become Unconscious.

The EP costs are as follows:

- Total success = 3 EP
- Partial success (inconvenience) = 2 EP
- Partial success (negative consequence) = 1 EP

### Testing your Luck

If you run out of Energy Points from a Stat pool, or don’t want to spend any, but still want to perform an Action, you must roll to Test your Luck.

Roll 1d6. If you roll a 4, 5 or 6, your Action is a total success. If you roll a 1, 2 or 3, it’s a total failure, with negative consequences.

### Inconveniences and Consequences

The nature of any inconvenience or negative consequence to your Action is usually just narrative. However, the Guide may add some mechanical effects, such as imposing Disadvantage on your next Action, having you lose EP from a Stat pool, or even miss your next turn.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Characters may have Advantage or Disadvantage on certain Actions.

- Advantage: when spending EP to perform the Action, reduce the EP costs by 1. When Testing your Luck to perform the Action, add 1 to your roll.

- Disadvantage: when spending EP to perform the Action, increase the EP costs by 1. When Testing your Luck to perform the Action, subtract 1 from your roll.

The effects of Advantage and Disadvantage stack. For example, if a Character has Advantage on their next Action, further Advantage can be applied. If a Character has both Advantage and Disadvantage on an Action, the two cancel each other out and the Action is to be performed normally.

## Difficulty

Sometimes, the Guide may decide that an Action being attempted would be particularly difficult, given the circumstances. There are 4 levels of difficulty:

- **Normal**: no change to EP costs or Test your Luck rolls.
- **Tricky**: EP costs increase by 1, no change to Test your Luck rolls.
- **Tough**: EP costs increase by 2, subtract 1 from Test your Luck rolls.
- **Challenging**: EP costs increase by 3, subtract 2 from Test your Luck rolls.

The effects of Difficulty stack on top of any pre-existing Disadvantage on the Action. Therefore, for example, a Test your Luck roll made with Disadvantage on a Challenging Action will always fail.

## Size, Range and Detail

Objects and Creatures can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large or Huge. They can also be Close, Nearby, Far Away or Very Far Away, and bare varying degrees of complexity.

### Size

- **Tiny**: fits in the palm of an average human hand, or in a pocket. An Area measuring an average human hand-width in diameter.
- **Small**: half the size of the average human. An Area less than a pace in diameter.
- **Medium**: roughly the same size as the average human. An Area a few paces in diameter.
- **Large**: about twice the size as the average human. An Area many paces in diameter.
- **Huge**: roughly the same size or more as an average two floor building. An Area over a hundred paces in diameter.

### Range

- **Close**: less than a pace away, requires no movement to reach.
- **Nearby**: a few paces away, can be reached during a turn.
- **Far Away**: many paces away, requires more than 1 turn’s movement to reach.
- **Very Far Away**: over a hundred paces away, requires several turns’ movement to reach (Guide’s discretion).

### Detail

- **No details**: has a featureless shape, and no moving parts.
- **Simple**: bares some rudimentary details, and a few moving parts.
- **Complex**: detail is fairly refined, and has several moving parts.
- **Intricate**: bares a large amount of detail, and a great many moving parts.

## Turns

If turns are needed (for example during intense situations like chases or combat), Turn order can be decided as a group, or be determined through rolling dice, with the highest results going first. Each Character can do 2 things during their turn: Move and perform an Action. On their turn, they can Move twice, perform two Actions, or Move and perform an Action.

## Conditions

There are four main Conditions: Blocked, Hurt, Inspired, and Unconscious.

### Blocked

If a Character is temporarily restrained, immobilised, disoriented or terrified, they are Blocked. Depending on the narrative, the Guide may decide whether a Blocked Character misses 1 or more turns, until they are released or receive assistance.

A Character who is Blocked may not perform any Action, except to Test their Luck to see if they can free themselves of the Condition.

### Hurt

If a Character fails to avoid harm or an attack, or falls afoul of negative consequences to an Action, they may become Hurt. While Hurt, and until healed, the Character suffers some negative effects. If they are hurt again while already Hurt, they become Badly Hurt, and if hurt further, Seriously Hurt.

- **Hurt** = Disadvantage on any Actions that would be affected by their injury or wound.
- **Badly Hurt** = Disadvantage on all Actions.
- **Seriously Hurt** = Disadvantage on all Actions, and lose 1d6 Points from each Pool for every turn until healed. If the Character is hurt again while already Seriously Hurt, they may fall Unconscious or die (depending on the game’s tone).

### Inspired

If a Character witnesses something truly amazing, heroic or moving, they may become Inspired. While Inspired, they receive Advantage on the next Action of their choice.

### Unconscious

Fairly self-explanatory, the Character is unconscious and so unable to perform any Actions, until they become conscious again.

## Vulnerability, Resistance and Immunity

Thanks to their Traits, a Character may have Vulnerability, Resistance or even Immunity to certain things.

- Vulnerability to X: Disadvantage when attempting to avoid X.
- Resistance to X: Advantage when attempting to avoid X.
- Immunity to X: no Energy Points or Tests of Luck are required to successfully avoid X.

## Skills

Skills are things the Character has had some amount of training and experience in doing before. When using a Skill in an Action, the Character has Advantage.

There is no set list of Skills, save for the following: Healing, Combat and Power.

### Healing

Remove or reduce a Character’s Hurt condition. For example, a Badly Hurt Character will become Hurt, and a Hurt Character will be restored to full health.

Healing can be achieved through traditional means such as medicine, advanced technology, or use of Power.

### Combat

Inflict the Hurt, Blocked or Unconscious condition on another Character. This can be achieved through the use of weapons, or unarmed martial arts. A Character can have a Combat Skill in one type of weapon, or a form of martial art.

### Power

Power in Four Points represents whatever unique way in which Characters in your setting can affect the world around them. In a fantasy setting this could be spell-casting, in a cyberpunk setting it could be technomancy, and in a horror setting it could be summoning demons or exorcising ghosts.

#### Power Types

In a setting, Power is sorted into one or more Types. A Power’s Type determines its scope or area of influence. In a Fantasy setting, for example, Power Types could be different schools of magic, such as Illusion or Light.

#### Using Power

To use Power as an Action, you spend Energy Points from the Stat pool most relevant to your Power Type. For example, if your Character’s Power Type is super-speed, the relevant Stat might be Dexterity. If it is lightning manipulation, it might be Stamina. Actions using Power are only limited by your Power Type, but The Guide and Players may choose to create a list of set Power Actions to choose from.

#### Power Side Effects (Optional)

The Guide may decide that, in a given situation, use of Power may be particularly unpredictable. In such a situation, after using Power in an Action (regardless of success) you must roll for Side Effects (1d6).

If you roll 5 or 6, there is an unexpected positive side effect.

If you roll 3 or 4, there is no side effect. If you roll 1 or 2, there is a negative side effect.

Side Effects to Power, whether positive or negative, can be wholly narrative in nature, or also have mechanical implications. These could include Advantage or Disadvantage on your next Action, restoring or losing 1d6’s worth of EP, or a missed turn.

### Learning new Skills

During Progression (see below), a Character may acquire new Skills. The number and nature of the Skills acquired must be narratively consistent and agreed upon by the Player group.

A Character may have a maximum of 10 known Skills, but these may be swapped out for new ones (see Character Creation section).

## Traits and Abilities

Traits are physiological or anatomical attributes inherent to the Character’s Folk.

Traits can afford Advantages, Disadvantages and Abilities.

Abilities are things a Character can do naturally, often thanks to a Trait.

Abilities have no Energy Point cost and are automatically successful, unless they are used as part of another Action, in which case the standard rules apply. If an Ability would be difficult to use at the time, the Guide may ask the Player Character to Test their Luck.

See the Guide Section for Lists of example Traits and Abilities.

## Resting

Whenever your Character gets a chance to rest, they may recover some Energy Points. When they have a short rest (2 to 3 hours) you may roll 1d6 and distribute the result across your Stat point pools. If they have a long rest (minimum 6 hours), you may roll 2d6. Depending on the situation in game, you may increase the amount of Rest dice to roll (Guide’s discretion).

## Progression

After completing an Adventure, each Character has the chance to increase their base amount of Energy Points. Each Player rolls 1d6 and distributes the result across their Stat pools, increasing the maximum amount of EP. If during the Adventure, a player had a particularly big influence on the outcome of the game, displayed some really engaging role-play, or even made the funniest joke, the rest of the group can award them an extra 1d6 for Progression.

# Character Creation | Mechanics

### Choosing a Folk

Depending on the setting of your game, you might have several playable Folk or Species to choose from when creating your Character. Your Character might be a human, or a fantastical creature, an alien, a robot or something else entirely. Whatever you pick, you’ll usually get some Traits and Abilities. Make a note of these.

### Determining Stats and Skills

Next, you’ll need to determine how many Energy Points you have per Stat pool and what Skills you possess. This can be accomplished in one of two ways: by using the **8 dice method** or choosing **Experiences**.

#### 8 Dice Method

Take 8d6. You will need these to determine how many Energy Points your Character has in each Stat pool. You have two options:

- Option 1 is to distribute the 8d6 across the four Stats. <br/> For example, Player A puts 3d6 in Wits, 2d6 in Stamina, 1d6 in Dexterity, and 2d6 in Sociability. <br/> Next, roll the dice for each Stat to get your Pool of Energy Points for each Stat. <br/> Player A’s Character now has 10 EP in Wits, 7 in Stamina, 5 in Dexterity, and 8 in Sociability.

- Option 2 is to roll all 8d6 together to generate a single pool of Energy Points, before distributing the points across your four Stats. <br/> For example, Player B rolls their 8d6, and gets a total of 37 EP. They then distribute those points across their Stats, putting 7 EP into Wits, 10 into Stamina, 11 into Dexterity, and 9 into Sociability.

Regarding Skills, your Character can start their adventure with any 8 Skills of their choice. Alternatively, the Guide may provide a list of career paths or areas of expertise, that each come with 4 assigned Skills.

For example, an expertise in technology or engineering could come with the Skills of hacking, programming, repairing technology and building technology.

The Player may then select another 4 Skills of their choice, not necessarily tied to their expertise, for a total of 8 Skills.

#### Choosing Experiences

This method is recommended for Players who enjoy coming up with a detailed backstory for their Character, and want that background to directly affect their Character build.

Start with 1d6 per Stat, then choose from the list of Experiences that will add dice to each Stat, afford Skills, and sometimes Advantages or Disadvantages.

##### Age

To determine how many Experiences and Skills your Character starts their Adventure with, you must first determine their Age.

There are three Age categories: Young, Adult and Elderly.

- A Young Character starts with 6 Experiences and 6 Skills,
- An Adult Character starts with 8 Experiences and 10 Skills,
- An Elderly Character starts with 10 Experiences and 8 Skills.

##### Building your Character from Experiences

You can read through the list and create a backstory for your Character as you go, or attempt to find the Experiences that best match the events of a backstory you have already prepared. The same Experience may be chosen more than once.

Once you have determined how many d6 you have per Stat, roll those dice to determine how many Energy Points are in each Stat pool.

See the end of this Chapter for a full list of Experiences.

##### Example Experience

**I have travelled to survive**

+1d6 to STA or DEX,

Skill (choose one): Finding the means to survive OR Finding shelter / accommodation.

_For whatever reason - a natural disaster, conflict, punishment or persecution - you have moved from place to place just to survive. Whether you were travelling alone or with others, you have skills in finding what you need to live in various environments, wild or not._

##### Adding or Substituting Skills

If a Character has all their Experiences but still has fewer Skills than allowed, they may add more Skills by deducting one Point from the most relevant Stat pool (1 EP = 1 Skill). For example, if a Character wants to have a Skill in Medicine, they may choose to deduct one Point from their Wits Stat pool, in order to learn that Skill.

Conversely, if a Character could technically still acquire more Skills from their Experiences, but already has their maximum allotted amount of Skills, they may substitute an existing Skill for a new one.

### Defence

A Character’s Defence score is determined by their armour and equipment, and represents how many times they can negate the Hurt Condition, even if they fail to evade an attack or harmful event. For example, if a Character has 2 Defence, their armour or equipment can take two hits, before the Character becomes Hurt.

### Equipment

Finally, decide what kind of Equipment your Character has with them, including any Mobility Aids, Medication, Armour, Shields or Weapons.

#### Mobility Aids

Your Character may be disabled and use a Mobility Aid (e.g. wheelchair, walker) and/or Prosthesis (e.g. artificial limb). As these items of Equipment primarily function to ensure the Character can perform any and all actions an abled Character can, they do not have a separate mechanical rule set within this system. They are to be considered parts of their body.

From a narrative perspective, these aids might have varying levels of technological sophistication or material costs. They might also be equipped for Combat, by adding weapons or a shield. A Mobility Aid or Prosthesis can be equipped with a maximum of 1 weapon and 1 shield.

#### Medication

For a disability that requires medicinal treatment rather than a mobility aid or prosthesis, you should discuss and determine the following with your Guide:

- What kind of medication does your Character require?
- How easy is it to acquire?
- How often does your Character need to take it?
- Do the symptoms - if untreated - have roleplaying implications?

#### Armour and Shields

Using Armour and Shields requires some degree of training, represented by requirements, depending on which method of Character Creation was used.

Additionally, they are categorised based on material weight and sturdiness: Light, Medium and Heavy. These will depend on the materials available in the world of the game’s setting.

- **Light Armour** = 1 Defence <br/> (Requires 1 Martial Experience / minimum 10 EP in STA or DEX)

- **Medium Armour** = 2 Defence <br/> (Requires 2 Martial Experiences / minimum 14 EP in STA or DEX)

- **Heavy Armour** = 3 Defence <br/> (Requires 3 Martial Experiences / minimum 18 EP in STA or DEX, Disadvantage on DEX Actions).

- **Shield** = 1 Defence, while raised.

Any Armour or Shield that has taken its allotted number of hits must be repaired before it can be used again. Once repaired, the Character’s Defence will reset to its original number.

Armour and Shields will require a number of days to repair equal to their Defence score (e.g. Light Armour will require 1 day to repair, Medium Armour will require 2, etc.)

#### Weapons

Weapons are also categorised into Light, Medium and Heavy. Weapons can be used to inflict the Hurt or Blocked Conditions.

- **Light Weapons** = any particularly small weapon (e.g. claws, fangs, daggers, hand-axes, etc.)
- **Medium Weapons** = any weapon that can be wielded both one and two-handed (e.g. spears, short-swords, clubs, bows, etc.)
- **Heavy Weapons** = any weapon that requires at least two hands to be used (e.g. broadswords, great hammers, heavy crossbows, etc.)

#### Special Items

Throughout the course of an Adventure, the Characters may encounter or acquire a variety of rare or powerful items, with singular properties.

These items, designed by the Guide or provided with a pre-written setting, may have one or more of the following effects:

- Restores 1d6 Points to one or more Stat pools,
- Causes a temporary or permanent Condition upon a Character,
- Affords a Character a temporary or permanent Vulnerability, Resistance or Immunity,
- Affords a Character a temporary or permanent Ability they would not otherwise possess,
- Affords Advantage on certain Actions,
- Re-roll Test for Luck rolls.

### Goals

It is important to have a clear idea of what motivates your Character’s journey and what they are working towards. Having one or more Goals established for the Character not only increases role-playing potential, but gives the Guide an extra opportunity to give an extra reward during Progression, if a Goal is reached. Once one Goal has been achieved, you may give your Character a new one to aim for.

### Bonds

Depending on your Character’s background and/or Experiences, they might know some important NPCs, or even have an existing relationship with one or more of their fellow PCs. Are these relationships positive or negative?

### Known Languages

Depending on the game’s setting, the Player might have a wide variety of Languages to choose from. If the game’s setting has no common lingua franca, it is important to consider what languages it would make most sense for the PC to communicate in.

# List of Experiences | Mechanics

What follows is the list of Experiences available for your Character.

They are sorted into the following categories: Criminal, Intellectual, Martial, Political, Powerful, Religious, Technical, Travelling, and Working.

### Criminal

- **I was brought up in a criminal environment:** <br/> +1d6 to SOC or DEX, <br/> Skill: one criminal Skill of your choice. <br/> _Your family - be they found or by blood - was used to breaking the law and, whether you wanted them to or not, some of their skills in criminal activities rubbed off on you. You may or may not still be involved in criminal activities._

- **I joined or founded a criminal organisation:** <br/> +1d6 to SOC or STA, <br/> Skill (choose one): one criminal Skill of your choice OR acquiring help or resources from your criminal organisation. <br/> _At some point in your life, for whatever reason, you founded or joined a criminal organisation. You may or may not still be a member. Discuss with your Guide the nature of your current relationship with criminal organisation and its members._

- **I willingly left a criminal organisation:** <br/> +1d6 to SOC or DEX, <br/> Skill: acquiring help or resources from former criminal organisation. <br/> _For whatever reason, you decided to leave the criminal organisation you were a part of. Whether you opted to continue a solo life of crime or turn over a new leaf, you still know how to reach the organisation. Discuss with your Guide the nature of your current relationship with criminal organisation and its members._

- **I was forced to leave a criminal organisation:** <br/> +1d6 to SOC or DEX, <br/> Skill: masquerading as a member of former criminal organisation, <br/> Disadvantage on Actions when dealing with people who know you from former organisation. <br/> _For whatever reason, you had to leave the criminal organisation you were a part of. Whether you opted to continue a solo life of crime or turn over a new leaf, you still have knowledge of the organisation’s workings, which could be either beneficial or detrimental to your prospects. _

- **I turned to crime for survival:** <br/> +1d6 to DEX or WIT, <br/> Skill: one method of avoiding law enforcement of your choice. <br/> _You spent some or a fair amount of your life in adversity, and without other options you had to steal, con or even kill just to stay alive. Whether alone or part of a criminal organisation to seek help / protection from, you nonetheless had to develop skills in making quick getaways and keeping out of sight of law enforcement._

- **I turned to crime for excitement:** <br/> +1d6 to SOC or DEX, <br/> Skill: one method of antagonising law enforcement of your choice. <br/> _Bored of your everyday routine, you sought new and exciting experiences by breaking the law and evading capture. Whether your crimes were petty or serious, you sought the rush of notoriety and the thrill of being pursued by the forces of law and order. You might even have adopted theatrics and charisma to become a beloved - or feared - criminal figure._

- **I turned to crime for a cause:** <br/> +1d6 STA or SOC, <br/> Skill: interacting with people who sympathise with your cause, <br/> Advantage on criminal Actions motivated by your cause. <br/> _For whatever reason, you are driven by a single purpose or principle that you were not able to further through legal means. You may have broken the law to help the needy, to get revenge, to rescue a loved one, to serve or depose a powerful figure. Whatever your cause, it inspired your criminal career and might have even earned you some degree of fame and notoriety._

- **I have been punished for a crime:** <br/> +1d6 to one Stat pool of your choice, <br/> Skill: one criminal Skill of your choice. <br/> _You have spent some or a fair amount of your life incarcerated or otherwise punished for a crime that you may or may not have committed. Depending on the type or punishment, you might have needed - or been given the opportunity - to develop your stamina, dexterity, wits or sociability. Guilty or innocent, your punishment may have changed you and the way people who know you - and your past - interact with you (discuss with your Guide)._

- **I escaped my punishment:** <br/> +1d6 to STA or DEX, <br/> Skill: one method of avoiding law enforcement of your choice. <br/> _At some point in your life you were incarcerated or otherwise punished, but you did not serve your full sentence, preferring instead to make a break for freedom. Either through cunning, collaboration or violence, you escaped your punishment and became adept at keeping out of the way of law enforcement. Discuss the nature of your current relationship with people who know of your imprisonment and escape with your Guide._

- **I got in trouble with law enforcement:** <br/> +1d6 to WIT or DEX <br/> Skill: one method of avoiding law enforcement of your choice. <br/> _At some point in your life - through your own fault, someone else’s or purely by accident - you became embroiled in some criminal activity, or were accused of such.

# Guide Section

The following chapter covers information useful for Guides who are looking to build a setting for their game of Four Points.

## Building a Setting

When creating a setting, you may want to consider the following: what kind of beings populate your setting and is there something special about it? The playable inhabitants of your world are referred to as Folk in this document, but could also be considered Species, depending on the setting.

You can use the same process outlined below to build non-playable creatures that live in your setting, such as animals, mythical creatures and more (see Building NPCs section).

### Building Folk

What kind of beings live in the world you will be playing in? The types of Folk that inhabit your setting may depend on its genre. You may choose to adapt archetypal high fantasy Folk such as elves and dwarfs into the Four Points system, or create a plethora of weird and wonderful alien species. Whatever the case, when creating a Folk, you will most likely need to decide on its Traits and Abilities.

Some might be common to all members of your Folk, while others could be optional.

For example, a species of frog or newt-like creatures might all possess the Amphibious Trait, but some might possess the Ability to naturally camouflage themselves, while others the Ability to produce a bioluminescent glow. Giving the Players more choice can lead to greater variety within the same Species or Folk.

This document provides an extensive list of example Traits and Abilities for you to choose from or modify (see final section of this chapter).

Alternatively, you may wish to build some of your own.

#### Building Traits

When creating a Trait, try to include one thing that benefits the Folk and one that provides no benefit or even an adverse effect. A Trait could include any of the following combinations:

- 1 Advantage + 1 Disadvantage
- 1 Ability + 1 Disadvantage or Vulnerability
- 1 Resistance + 1 Ability
- 1 Immunity + 1 Vulnerability
- 1 Ability or 1 Ability from a list of options

#### Building Abilities

When creating an Ability, try to include a Trait requirement or something special that cannot already be accomplished by a Skill. An Ability could include any of the following combinations:

- Trait requirement + cause a Condition
- Trait requirement + special movement and/or a temporary Advantage
- Special movement and/or temporary Advantage
- Cause multiple Conditions

### Power and Power Types

Consider how structured your want Power to be in your setting, using the following questions as prompts:

- Is there just one Power Type in your setting, or are there many to choose from?
- Is Power something rare and still partially unexplored, or is it commonplace?
- How many Power Types can an inhabitant of your setting know and use?
- How easy or difficult is it to have Power? Can it be learned, is it innate, or a mix of both?

### Exploration and Cooperative World-building

Whether or not you decide to populate your setting with a variety of Folk, or include some form of Power within it, try to leave some parts of it as mysterious or unknowns.

You game-play can be enhanced by letting the Characters and their backstories inform the world, and leaving room to expand and explore.

For example, in a fantasy setting, there might be a large kingdom, which is mapped out, containing important places to visit or people to meet, for the bulk of the adventure.

However, one of the Players might have made a Character who was or is still working for the government of a rival enemy country.

If you are the Guide, try working with this Player to flesh out what this enemy country is like. Is their government simply paranoid or do they have just cause to be suspicious of the kingdom? Are they planning to spy on the kingdom or declare war? Are their culture and values at odds with those of the kingdom or are they actually quite similar?

### Setting Checklist

The following list of questions can be used as a tool to help you and your fellow Players through the Setting Building process.

- What is the genre of your Setting?
- What is the scope of your Setting? Will you be adventuring across an entire continent, planet or galaxy, or will your game take place within the confines of a single town or building?
- Does your Setting include any Type of Power and Effects?
- How does Power function within your Setting?
- Is your Setting populated by multiple Folk?
- What are the Traits and Abilities of your Setting’s Folk?
- Are there parts or elements of your Setting still to be discovered or explored?

## Building NPCs

This section covers creating Non-Player Characters that you, as the game’s Guide, will be playing as. To build an NPC, you can follow these steps.

### Choosing a Folk

First, choose a Folk for your NPC, and make note of their Traits and Abilities. As the Guide does not spend Energy Points or roll dice in Four Points, you can instead assign Difficulty to your NPC’s Traits and Abilities. As an example, let’s build a Catfolk NPC.

### Assigning Difficulty

How much of a challenge is your NPC going to be for your Players?

You can start by assigning the NPC a base Difficulty, or separate Difficulties for each of their Stats. Next consider how the NPC’s Difficulty might increase or decrease based on their Traits, Abilities and Skills.

If the NPC has a Trait that affords them an Advantage on a certain Action, or is Skilled in that Action, you can increase their Difficulty by 1 or more levels when they perform it.

The NPC’s Difficulty will also be affected by any Conditions applied to them.

If an NPC is Hurt, their Difficulty might go down by 1 level. Conversely, if they are Inspired, it might go up by 1.

Let’s continue building our Catfolk NPC, who is quick-witted and nimble, but not very physically imposing. Their Difficulty will be Tricky against Wits, Dexterity and Sociability Actions, and Normal against Stamina Actions.

Their Traits include Heightened Senses and a Tail. These Traits would normally afford Advantage on avoiding surprise attacks and Resistance against being Blocked by being knocked over. As this is an NPC, it means their Difficulty will go up if the Players attempt a surprise attack against them, or try to knock them over.

Next we’ll give them Skills. These could include Deception. This means that if a Player Character is performing a Sociability Action to determine if our Catfolk NPC is lying, the latter’s Difficulty level will go up to Tough, or even Challenging.

### Defence

As for Defence, this is simply determined by whether or not you want your NPC to wear any armour or carry a shield.

Our Catfolk NPC will have Light Armour, which affords them 1 Defence.

### Performing Actions

As previously mentioned, the Guide does not spend Points or roll dice.

This means you, as Guide, can decide how successful your want your NPC’s Action to be, unless it is opposed or hostile towards one or more Player Characters. In this case, the Players determine its success, by successfully avoiding or negating it by spending EP, or Testing their Luck.

### Sample NPC
