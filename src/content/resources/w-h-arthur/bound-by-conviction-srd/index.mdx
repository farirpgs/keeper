## Introduction

**Bound by Conviction** is a System Reference Document (SRD) for designing tabletop role-playing games based on [W.H. Arthur’s _CONVICT-ION_](https://aryl-ether.itch.io/convict-ion). It is a token-based system for telling stories about identity, gender and superpowers, in which characters in an allegorical prison struggle against social norms, a terrifying villain and fate itself.

The system is derived from the Belonging Outside Belonging system, first used in _Dream Askew/Dream Apart_ by Avery Alder and Benjamin Rosenbaum. It also draws inspirations from _Sleepaway_ by Jay Dragon, _Flotsam: Adrift Amongst the Stars_ by Joshua Fox, and _Apocalypse World_ by D. Vincent Baker and Meguey Baker.

Special thanks to Chloe Montgomery for serving as the sensitivity consultant to the _CONVICT-ION_ project.

This document contains the license of the system, the core rules and the scenario _Existence is Queer_ from _CONVICT-ION_, and a guide in making your own Bound by Conviction game.

## Themes

Bound by Conviction draws influence from the writings of Judith Butler and Michel Foucault, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure by Hirohiko Araki, the Persona series by Atlus and the Life is Strange series by Don’t Nod/Deck Nine.

A Bound by Conviction game has the following themes:

- A critical look at systems and structures in society that seek to enforce norms and suppress individuality
- Characters with convictions who strive to be their authentic selves despite it all
- Superpowers that are linked to one’s identity
- A terrifying villain with some degree of authority
- A fascination with campiness or the bizarre

Each Bound by Conviction scenario is a standalone game, in which the systems and structures in the society form the basis of an allegorical “prison”, and the characters who strive to be their authentic selves are the Convicted.

Performativity is the philosophical concept that words and actions alter our social reality. Textbook examples include a judge pronouncing a verdict in a court and a priest declaring a couple “husband and wife” in a wedding ceremony. Inspired by Judith Butler’s writing on gender performativity, each Convicted has a reality-altering power called GENDER, which is linked to their identity.

In the scenario _Existence is Queer_, the Convicted are the students in a small coastal town. The school and town form the “prison” which seeks to normalise the students and turn them into useful tools for the society. The villain is a predator who holds a teaching position at the school.

The goal of a Bound by Conviction game is not to “win”, but to tell gripping, and perhaps cathartic tales about the Convicted’s struggle against society to be authentic and free.

Due to the nature of the topics that are being explored, one should include content warnings and discussion of safety tools in their Bound by Conviction game.

# Bound by Conviction—Core Rules

> **_The story takes place in a “prison”, and you play as one of the CONVICTED—characters with CONVICTIONS.  
> Each of you has a CONVICTION—a belief that guides you through life.  
> Each of you has a CONVICTION—a deviant act or trait that the society labels as a crime.  
> Both your CONVICTIONS—internal sense of self and struggle with social norms—manifest into a special ability called GENDER.  
> Embody your GENDER to find the truth and break free from your assigned fate._**

## Requirements

These are things required for a typical Bound by Conviction game:

- 3-6 players including a facilitator\*
- 2-4 hours
- Writing materials\*\*
- A bunch of tokens (~5 per player)—poker chips, cigarettes, instant ramen, dice, or anything you can find

**Potentially 2-7 players with an experienced facilitator\*  
\***Writing materials and tokens can be substituted with digital equivalent when playing online\*

## The Conversation

To play a tabletop role-playing game is to have a conversation. The players take turns talking about their fictional characters and their circumstances, building on top of the established fictional world. Like any conversation, players don’t necessarily follow a rigid “turn order”, but join in whenever they have something to say.

When you play a role-playing game, you and the other players come together to have a specific conversation—one that tells a story centred around certain themes. The rules of a game offer prompts and constraint to guide players toward that goal.

## Safety

Gaming is supposed to be fun for everyone. It is the duty of the players to ensure a safe environment for each other. Before the start of a session, establish the lines & veils for the game. Lines are topics that should never appear in the game, while veils are topics that might be mentioned in passing but not discussed in detail. People might add things to the list later on and that’s fine.

Also discuss what players expect to see, and set the tone of the game. Do people want a more lighthearted story that focuses on the superpower battles? A mystery story where the players investigate the missing persons cases? Or a story on how the characters build a community amid the hostile circumstances? Do players expect romance between their characters?
Establish a way that players can voice their discomfort during the game. Let the players know that they can always say “no” and offer an alternative if they are comfortable to. Many gaming tables use the X-card, where a player can tap it to let other players know that are uncomfortable, and the scene would be skipped.

One should also try to check-in with other players once in a while, making sure that everyone at the table is comfortable.

## Prompts & Tokens

The game is centred around **Prompts**, which are both narrative instructions and mechanical triggers.

Prompts for a Convicted are centred around consequences, either narrative or mechanical.

- For a Convicted’s **Standard Prompt**, they can always take action and face consequence\*.
- A Convicted’s **Vulnerable Prompt** put them into trouble, but gives them a token.
- A Convicted’s **Tough Prompt** offers them narrative advantage at the cost of a token. On the flip-side, a Convicted cannot perform the instruction of a Tough Prompt unless they have a token to spend.

\*_The consequence of the action is equivalent to the action undertaken. Mundane actions have mundane consequences; you exit a building and you are now outside. High-stakes actions have high-stakes consequences; you get into a knife fight and someone gets stabbed._

Circumstances have Prompts that any player can use to introduce complications to the story, which can be used when the Convicted are looking for direction or when narratively appropriate. Circumstances and minor characters do not gain or spend tokens.

## The Basics

**VULNERABLE PROMPT (Gain a token and mark experience)**

- Get into trouble with your CONVICTION

**TOUGH PROMPT (Spend a token)**

- Overcome adversity with your CONVICTION

**STANDARD PROMPT (Do any time)**

- Take action and open yourself to consequences

**GENDER PROMPT (Spend two tokens)**

- Achieve an extraordinary feat with your GENDER

**ALSO DO (When narratively appropriate)**

- Suggest consequences for a Convicted’s action, and use Prompts from Circumstances

## The Setting

The “prison” in the game does not have to be a literal one. It is a place where the Convicted are held captive and are expected to abide to the imposed norms. It might be a boarding school, a cyberpunk police state, an asteroid mining outpost, or just a society in late-stage capitalism.

The story takes place in the “prison”, and the Convicted cannot leave it during the game. However, if a prison break is what the players set their mind to, the story can be about the Convicted searching for a way out. The resolution of the prison break can happen at the end of a game session. Since the “prison” is metaphor, if the players decide to continue with the game in another session, they can continue the story of the Convicted in a new “prison”, and rewrite each of the Circumstances. For example, they can escape from a prison, only to find the society at large is no less restrictive.

### The Circumstances

On top of the Convicted, the players also collectively control the Circumstances. The Circumstances are The “Prison”, The Guards, The Gangs, The Economy, Fate/Karma, The Bizarre and The Warden.

**The “Prison”** establishes the setting of the game.

**The Guards** hold authority over the “prisoners”.

**The Gangs** are the other “prisoners”/minor characters of the story.

**The Economy** offers what the Convicted need, at a cost.

**Fate/Karma** plays out the consequences of earlier actions.

**The Bizarre** amps up the strangeness of the story.

**The Warden** is a villain that haunts the Convicted. In guided play, the facilitator has exclusive control of The Warden playbook.

## GMless & Guided Play

There are two ways for the facilitator to run the game—as a fully GMless experience or to take a more active role in guiding the players.

In **GMless Play**, the facilitator plays one of the Convicted just like any other player of the game, and the Circumstances are shared between all the players.

In **Guided Play**, the facilitator does not control a Convicted, but gains full control of The Warden Circumstance. The other Circumstances are shared between all players, but the facilitator often have a more active role in applying them.
GMless Play is more suited for players who are familiar with the Belonging Outside Belonging system, or players who are more used to storytelling and improv.

Guided Play is more suited for convention games and games with a shorter play time. The Warden becomes the major threat and something the players have to work together to defeat or escape.

## Getting Started

<u>Playing with one of the pre-made scenarios:</u>
1. Prepare what you need and gather everyone around a table (or an online
chatroom) 2. The facilitator should go through the sections The Conversation,
Safety, Prompts & Tokens, The Setting and The Circumstances. 3. Each player
picks a Convicted from the scenario, altering their names and pronouns if
desired. 4. The players go through the Circumstances and read them aloud. 5.
Each player introduces their character, adding in their own details. After
everyone has introduced their character, answer the bond questions. 6. Begin the
game by having each player describe what their character is up to, and come up
with a reason for the characters to come together.

## The Convicted

The Convicted are the player characters. Each of the Convicted has CONVICTIONS (Belief and Crime) and a GENDER, as well as a backstory and a tie to the warden.

At the start of a game, the players would introduce themselves as their Convicted (making adjustments to their details as they wish), and answer the bond questions afterwards.

Guide to role-play as the Convicted:

- Act with conviction and embrace the consequences!
- Don’t be afraid to let your character fail and mess up!
- Make your character fallible and relatable.

### CONVICTION (Belief)

Each of the Convicted starts with a CONVICTION, a core belief or strong desire they hold.

A CONVICTION (Belief) can get a Convicted into trouble (triggering a Vulnerable Prompt), but it can also be used to overcome adversity (triggering a Tough Prompt).

### CONVICTION (Crime)

Each of the Convicted also starts with a CONVICTION, a deviant act or trait that society labels as a “crime”. It doesn’t have to be an actual crime, and a Convicted might not have actually committed it. After all, a crime is a label for a behaviour that doesn’t fall into the norms accepted by those in power.

A CONVICTION (Crime) can also act like a skill or an ability. For example, if one’s convicted of larceny, they can incorporate their thieving skills to trigger the Tough Prompt. A reputation of being a larcenist might also get the Convicted into trouble and trigger a Vulnerable Prompt.

### GENDER

GENDER is the embodiment of a Convicted’s self-knowledge gained through the navigation of their internal sense of self and struggle with social norms. It grants the wielder a special ability.
A GENDER appears as a humanoid figure to GENDER wielders, but is invisible to anyone else. In most cases, a GENDER is tethered to its wielder and cannot move beyond their personal space. Narratively, when a Convicted uses their GENDER’s special ability, they can decide whether it activates from their own body or the embodied GENDER.
A Convicted always has access to their GENDER’s special ability, and they can incorporate it narratively into any Prompt. Unlike Tough Prompt, the GENDER Prompt bypasses the need to include a CONVICTION, giving the player more flexibility at the cost of an extra token.

To create a GENDER, come up with a special ability that fits thematically with the Convicted and their CONVICTIONS. Then give it a suitable name, perhaps one inspired by music.

A Convicted’s GENDER might or might not be the gender they identify as.

### Bonds

After everyone has introduced their Convicted, each player answers both bond questions for their Convicted and elaborate on the answers.

- Pick a Convicted that either is someone you have failed in the past or reminds you of them. You promise yourself that you would make it right this time.
- Pick a Convicted you can rely on or seek solace in. What makes you trust them?

## Realisation

Every time a Vulnerable Prompt is triggered, the player marks experience. A player may trade 5 experience for a **Realisation**.

A Convicted picks one of the following Realisations for the first three times (each of them can only be picked once):

- Add or modify a CONVICTION (Belief)
- Add or modify a CONVICTION (Crime)
- Gain an extra token

After the initial three options are picked, a Convicted may choose from any of the following Realisations:

- Add or modify a CONVICTION (Any)
- Gain an extra token
- Evolve your GENDER, altering its special ability
- Retire your Convicted and create a new one
  - Narrate how the Convicted leaves the group, and where they are off to next
  - This is the only way a Convicted can escape the “prison” mid-game
  - At the player’s discretion, the Convicted may return as a threat (perhaps taking over as the new Warden)

## Default Circumstances

Each of the Circumstances contains a description and prompts. For an in-person game, the Circumstances can be printed and cut out, and passed around the table during play.

### The “Prison”

This is the setting of the game. When designing it, offer locations of interest and potential activities for the “prisoners”.

**Prompts:**

- When someone visits a new place, describe the environment
- Present the Convicted with an activity (compulsory and otherwise)
- Show someone they are being watched

### The Guards

The Guards are here to make sure the “prisoners” follow the rules. Depends on the setting, some of them might even be well-meaning, but they ultimately uphold the system of the “prison”. Give recurring Guards names and personalities.

**Prompts:**

- Tell someone a rule they are expected to follow
- Reprimand a rule-breaker
- Have a Guard abuse their authority to get what they want

### The Gangs

The Gangs are the other “prisoners”/minor characters. When a new character is introduced, give them a name and a CONVICTION (Any). Give them a GENDER when the narrative calls for it. Any player can pick up a minor character and play them.

**Prompts:**

- Introduce someone who needs help
- Introduce someone with dubious motive
- Have an existing character inconvenience the Convicted at a bad moment

### The Economy

Resources in the “prison” are scarce. If a Convicted needs something badly, they would have to pay a price for it.

**Prompts:**

- Offer what someone needs, at a cost
- Offer something for free, but let the recipient knows there is a catch
- Punish those who give charity

### Fate/Karma

Cause determines effect, action leads to consequence—are we mere prisoners to our fate?

**Prompts:**

- Show someone a dark omen
- Develop a recurring motif
- Reveal consequence of an earlier action

### The Bizarre

The Bizarre manifests itself in several ways—supernatural elements, campiness and horror.

**Prompts:**

- Introduce a supernatural element to the story
- Have someone (including the Convicted you control) engage in theatrics and/or take a mundane situation way too seriously
- Unveil an unexpected horror element of the story (building up on what is established earlier)

### The Warden

The Warden is the bogeyman of the “prison”. They are not necessarily the person in charge, just someone with a degree of authority over the Convicted. They hold a dark conviction in secret, and commit acts so heinous that their authority would not protect them.

The Warden has a CONVICTION (Belief) and GENDER.

Each of the Convicted has a personal tie with the Warden, and each player chooses whether their Convicted are hunting or being hunted by them. (Either way, the Convicted do not know the true identity of the Warden at the start.)
The Warden has 6 Plot Armour points.

**Special Prompt**—After a Convicted has spent token(s) on a Prompt, you may place them here to cancel its effect and describe how the Warden is one step ahead. (Cannot exceed Plot Armour)

**Prompts:**

- Act with CONVICTION
- Hide behind your persona and take advantage of your authority
- Get out of a sticky situation scot-free
- Scheme with other Circumstances
- Do a quirky thing
- Kill a minor character
- Assign someone a new CONVICTION
- (Holding 4+ tokens) Evolve your GENDER
- (Holding 4+ tokens) Kill a Convicted with their player’s permission

# Scenario: Existence is Queer

**Content Warnings:** school, kidnapping, disappearance and death of minors, grief, losing control of one’s body, abusive teaching staff, grooming, medical horror

## BEACON Academy, Oldhaven

### The “Prison” Circumstance

Beacon Academy is situated in Oldhaven, an isolated coastal town. The setting of this scenario includes both the school and parts of the town.

Most residents of Oldhaven have lived here for their whole life, and people rarely leave. As teenagers studying in Beacon Academy, you can’t help but feel that every adult in Oldhaven either judges you, or has certain expectations of you. Many of you long to leave Oldhaven. But in order to do so, one would have to do well at school AND take out a huge loan to go to university. Also, not all of you would want to leave your family behind.

Like most schools, Beacon Academy aims to train students to be productive workers of the society. Students are taught how to answer questions but rarely how to ask them.

In recent years, there has been a string of missing persons cases involving students of Beacon Academy, but the police have found no foul play involved.

**Prompts:**

- When someone visits a new place, describe the environment
- Present the Convicted with an activity (compulsory or otherwise)
- Suggest town locations for the Convicted to visit out of school
- Show someone they are being watched

<u>Example school activities:</u>
Classes, recess/lunch break, after-school club, detention, school festival,
school play

<u>Example town locations:</u>
An inexpensive restaurant, lighthouse, bowling alley, medical museum, a park
where the misfits dwell, pleasure pier

## The Guards

The Guards in this scenario are the teaching staff at school and adults in town who think they can boss the youth around. They are here to make sure the students follow the rules and societal norms. Give them names and personalities.

At Beacon Academy, the teachers expect the students to follow the rules without complain. The students are required to pay attention in class at all times, only allow to eat in lunch break, and only allow to pee if they get a teacher’s permission during class.

In town, self-important adults think they can impose themselves on the youth just because of their seniority. Some assume the students are up to no good unless proven otherwise. Some are bitter because they have never lived freely in their life, and want the youth to suffer like them.

**Prompts:**

- Tell someone a rule they are expected to follow
- Reprimand a rule-breaker
- Have an adult abuse their authority to get what they want

## The Gangs

The Gangs in this scenario are the other students at school and the misfits in town. When a new character is introduced, give them a name and a CONVICTION (Any). Give them a GENDER when the narrative calls for it. Any player can pick up a minor character and play them.

Students in Beacon Academy can be friends or foes to the Convicted, sometimes even both! They may present the Convicted with problems that need fixing, or they might be bullies who want to assert their dominance.

Outside of school, the Convicted may choose to hang out with the misfits in town. Many misfits are good people who struggle to conform to the system. However, there are also wicked individuals who prey on the vulnerable.

**Prompts:**

- Introduce someone who needs help
- Introduce someone with dubious motive
- Have an existing character inconvenience the Convicted at a bad moment

## The Economy

The students don’t have much money. If a student needs something badly, they would have to pay a price for it.

**Prompts:**

- Offer what someone needs, at a cost
- Offer something for free, but let the recipient knows there is a catch
- Punish those who give charity

## Fate/Karma

Cause determines effect, action leads to consequence—are we mere prisoners to our fate?

**Prompts:**

- Show someone a dark omen
- Develop a recurring motif
- Reveal consequence of an earlier action

## The Bizarre

The Bizarre manifests itself in several ways—supernatural elements, campiness and horror.

**Prompts:**

- Introduce a supernatural element to the story
- Have someone (including the Convicted you control) engage in theatrics and/or take a mundane situation way too seriously
- Unveil an unexpected horror element of the story (building up on what is established earlier)

## Dr. Monroe

### The Warden Circumstance

Dr. Monroe (they/them) is a biology teacher at Beacon Academy. They are admired by many in the school for their lively classes and friendly personality. They have extensive knowledge on human anatomy and is a part-time curator of Oldhaven’s medical museum.

They are also the person responsible for the strings of disappearances in Beacon Academy. They use their position to scout out students who won’t be missed if they were to go missing. Dr. Monroe then kidnaps their prey and add them to their collection of specimens. Parts of the missing students may show up in the biology class or the medical museum.

(By default, Dr. Monroe murders their victims and harvest their body parts as biological specimens. For groups who want a lighter tone, the missing students are put into a kind of stasis by ACID HOUSE’s ability and stored as a whole, which can be rescued by the Convicted once Dr. Monroe is defeated.)

**CONVICTION (Belief):** The beauty of youth needs to be preserved

**GENDER:** ACID HOUSE (Put someone into a trance)

Each Convicted has a personal tie with the Warden, which is written on the Convicted playbooks for this scenario. (The Convicted do not know the true identity of the Warden at the start.)

The Warden has 6 Plot Armour points.

**Special Prompt**—After a Convicted has spent token(s) on a Prompt, you may place them here to cancel its effect and describe how the Warden is one step ahead. (Cannot exceed Plot Armour)

**Prompts:**

- Act with CONVICTION
- Hide behind your persona and take advantage of your authority
- Get out of a sticky situation scot-free
- Scheme with other Circumstances
- Do a quirky thing
- Kill a minor character
- Assign someone a new CONVICTION
- (Holding 4+ tokens) Evolve your GENDER
- (Holding 4+ tokens) Kill a Convicted with their player’s permission

## Polaris (she/her)

A science student and a creative at heart, Polaris is an avid photographer. She dropped out of art class after realising she could only make what her teacher wanted her to make. Most teachers at Beacon Academy tell her that she would have been a better student if she pays more attention in class, except for Dr. Monroe who is always supportive. Polaris is not a popular kid at school, and she hangs out with other misfits and outcasts like her. She is very protective towards those she consider her friends, and can be a bit too much of a people pleaser.

**CONVICTION (Belief):** I have to save my friends!

**CONVICTION (Crime):** Too much of a day-dreamer in class

**GENDER:**&emsp;STAR REACHER  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;Turn back time for several seconds

**Tie with the Warden:**

- Polaris has been making friends with the “undesirables” of Beacon Academy, which makes her an obstacle for Dr. Monroe. Dr. Monroe thus makes it a priority to get rid of her.

## Ash (they/she)

To the adults, Ash is just another rebel without a cause, a “punk” who causes trouble for the sake of it. To Ash, punk is much more than a rebellious attitude; it is life itself. One of their earliest memories is them seeing a weed sprouting out of a crack in concrete, and their mother commenting that “Life always find a way, no matter how restrictive the environment is”. They took it to heart, finding beauty in non-conformity.

**CONVICTION (Belief):** No one can tell me what to do!

**CONVICTION (Crime):** Disobeying teachers and authorities

- As someone who distrusts authority, Ash finds Dr. Monroe way too nice. They may do some nosing around to see what is under the facade.

## Faith (e/em/eir)

Faith is a wanderer who loves exploring abandoned buildings and getting lost in the woods surrounding the town of Oldhaven. That puts em at odds with the rich townsfolk who own the land and label Faith as a trespasser. While Faith comes across as a loner and a weirdo, eir best friend Hope is the exact opposite—a popular student adored by their classmates and the teachers. Hope has gone missing recently and Faith is going to do whatever it takes to find them.

**CONVICTION (Belief):** I have to find my missing friend!

## Wade (they/he)

Wade thinks that life is too short to not try everything at least once. They love surfing and parkour, and were caught swimming naked in the lake next to the campus. Wade don’t understand why the self-important adults have to tell them to be careful with their life, when it is the adults who are too scared to live life to its fullest. Lately, they have been struggling with science homework, and is grateful that Dr. Monroe is offering them extra help.

**CONVICTION (Belief):** You only live once!

To Lily, the plain walls of the town are so boring and oppressive, but ta sees the beauty that can be unlocked with tade spray cans and marker pens.

# Guide to make you own Bound by Conviction game

If the Bound by Conviction system inspires you, you can make your own game with it! You may use the system as it is and design a standalone scenario, take the system apart and tweak the mechanics, or take bits and pieces of the system and incorporate it into a new game you are designing.

## Making a Standalone scenario

Here is a step-by-step guide on designing your own Bound by Conviction game/standalone scenario:

1. Read the Core Rules and sample scenario.
2. Come up with your own “prison” setting. Give it a name, a description, locations of interest and potential activities. Modify the prompts on the “Prison” Circumstance if necessary.
3. Create the Warden, a terrifying villain with some degree of authority and a dark conviction. Give them a CONVICTION (Belief) and a GENDER. Modify the prompts on The Warden Circumstance if necessary.
4. Go through the rest of the Circumstances, modifying the descriptions and prompts to fit your “prison”.
5. Come up with colourful characters for the setting, “prisoners” with CONVICTIONS who strive to be their authentic selves despite the oppressive environment. They are the Convicted—player characters of your game.
   - Give each of them a name and backstory.
   - Give each of them a CONVICTION (Belief) and a CONVICTION (Crime).
   - Write down potential applications of their CONVICTIONS as extra prompts.
   - Give each of them a GENDER, a special ability that fits thematically with the Convicted and their CONVICTIONS. Then give - it a suitable name, perhaps one inspired by music.
   - Give each of them a tie to the Warden.
   - Include the Bond questions (to be answered by the players at the table).
6. Borrow text from the Core Rules, changing things as you see fit.
7. Provide content warnings and discussion of safety tools.
8. You now have a Bound by Conviction game!

_(Sometimes, it is more of a iterative process, where the creation of the Convicted gives you ideas to refine the “prison” setting and Circumstances.)_

## Tweaking the System

In a way, Bound by Conviction is designed to be a universal system about power and resistance, but it may not fit exactly what you want for your narrative. Feel free to do what you want to the game mechanics, and here are some suggestions to get you started.

### Rewriting the Circumstances

The traditional role of a Game Master is broken down into the Circumstances and distributed between the players. They are used to direct the narrative with a specific theme and vibes, and you might want to modify them or design new ones to suit your game.

For example, perhaps you are writing a cyberpunk game and want technology to play a huge part in the narrative. You may want to introduce a new Circumstance that directs players to interact with the cyberspace.

If your “prison” is a dystopian setting where neighbours are constantly spying on one another for the state, the line between “prison guards” and “prisoners” are blurred, so you may want to combine The Guards and The Gangs Circumstances into a single one.

The Economy Circumstance highlights the scarcity in the setting. If your game is set in a hostile environment such as a scorching desert or space, you may want to rewrite the Circumstance to highlight the lack of water or oxygen as an ever-present threat to the characters.

The default Circumstances are antagonistic, designed to put the “prisoners” in their place. Perhaps you want to include Solidarity as a new Circumstance, offering the Convicted a reprieve from the oppressive environment.

### Inter-PC mechanics

In the original Belonging Outside Belonging system, there is the lure mechanic. The lure prompts other player characters to help set up your character for a chance to shine.

Bound by Conviction forgoes the lure mechanic for a streamlined and modular character creation process, as well as putting an emphasis on the Convicted’s struggles against the Circumstances (especially The Warden). In your own game, you might want to think about mechanics that incentivise interactions between player characters.

### On GENDER

GENDER as a reality-altering power is inspired by Judith Butler’s writing on gender performativity. It is a statement on how one presents oneself in words and deeds has an effect on our social reality.

You may want to consider how other marginalised identities, by living authentically without being assimilated into the mainstream, to be the basis of your reality-altering power.
